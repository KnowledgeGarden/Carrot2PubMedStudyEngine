      <title>Effects of calcitriol and paricalcitol on renal fibrosis in CKD.</title>
      <snippet>In chronic kidney Disease (CKD) the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal inflammation stimulate renal fibrosis and the progression to end-stage renal disease. The low levels of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its activators (VDRAs) contribute to worsen secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal fibrosis.</snippet>

      <title>Active vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 infections: review.</title>
      <snippet>SARS-CoV-2, causing the lethal disease COVid-19, is a public health emergency in the 2020 global pandemic. The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis. In this review, we will explain the cross talk between the active vitamin D and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and summarize the data from the literature.</snippet>

      <title>Fibrosis in Chronic Kidney Disease: Pathogenesis and Consequences.</title>
      <snippet>Fibrosis is a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix as a response to different types of tissue injuries, which leads to organ dysfunction. The process can be initiated by multiple and different stimuli and pathogenic factors which trigger the cascade of reparation converging in molecular signals responsible of initiating and driving fibrosis. Though fibrosis can play a defensive role, in several circumstances at a certain stage, it can progressively become an uncontrolled irreversible and self-maintained process, named pathological fibrosis. Several systems, molecules and responses involved in the pathogenesis of the pathological fibrosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be discussed in this review, putting special attention on inflammation, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Klotho, microRNAs (miRs), and the vitamin D hormonal system. All of them are key factors of the core and regulatory pathways which drive fibrosis, having a great negative kidney and cardiac impact in CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Osteomalacia caused by atypical renal tubular acidosis with vitamin D deficiency: a case report.</title>
      <snippet> 11.8 mEq/L, anion gap 3.2 mEq/L). Tubular dysfunction, tubular damage, kidney stones, and inadequate urinary acidification were all observed, suggesting the presence of renal tubular acidosis from a combination of both distal and proximal origin. She also had overt proteinuria, decreased renal function, and hypothalamic hypogonadism. In addition to alfacalcidol, sodium bicarbonate and oral phosphorus supplementation were initiated. After this prescription, her pain dramatically improved in association with the restoration of acid-base balance and electrolytes; renal dysfunction and proteinuria were unaltered. This case indicated that careful assessments of tubular function and acid-base balance are essential for the management of osteomalacia in addition to the evaluation of the calcium/phosphate balance and vitamin D status.</snippet>

      <title>An update on vascular calcification and potential therapeutics.</title>
      <snippet>Pathological calcification is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidities primarily in population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal diseases (ERSD) and metabolic disorders. Investigators have accepted the fact that vascular calcification is not a passive process but a highly complex, cell mediated, active process in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulting from, metabolic insults of bone fragility, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Over the years, studies have revealed various mechanisms of vascular calcification like induction of bone formation, apoptosis, alteration in Ca-P balance and loss of inhibition. Novel clinical studies targeting cellular mechanisms of calcification provide promising and potential avenues for drug development. The interventions include phosphate binders, sodium thiosulphate, vitamin K, calcimimetics, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, Myoinositol hexaphosphate (IP6), Denosumab and TNAP inhibitors. Concurrently investigators are also working towards reversing or curing pathological calcification. This review focuses on the relationship of vascular calcification to clinical diseases, regulators and factors causing calcification including genetics which have been identified. At present, there is lack of any significant preventive measures for calcifications and hence this review explores further possibilities for drug development and treatment modalities.</snippet>

      <title>Old and New Drugs for the Management of Bone Disorders in CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing dialysis. Renal osteodystrophy, which describes an alteration of bone morphology, is an important component of this systemic disorder and may explain the elevated risk of fracture which adversely affects morbidity and mortality. The most common form of renal osteodystrophy is high-turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa), which is induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). During the past decade, there has been considerable advances in the management of SHPT, with the introduction of the calcimimetic agents, the optimized use of nutritional and active vitamin D, and the accumulated experience with surgical parathyroidectomy. Studies supported that these advances could translate into improvement of renal bone disease and fracture prevention, as well as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. In this review, we summarize the available clinical evidence on the effect of old and new drugs on bone disorders in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Prospective role of thyroid disorders in monitoring COVID-19 pandemic.</title>
      <snippet>COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 200 countries and 1.3 million individuals have deceased within eleven months. Intense research on COVID-19 occurrence and prevalence enable us to understand that comorbidities play a crucial role in spread and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension are among the various morbidities that are prevalent in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of altered thyroid-driven disorders cannot be ignored. Since thyroid hormone critically coordinate and regulate the major metabolism and biochemical pathways, this review is on the potential role of prevailing thyroid disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Direct link of thyroid hormone with several disorders such as diabetes, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, kidney and liver disorders etc. suggests that the prevailing thyroid conditions may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, we discuss the oxidative stress-induced aging is associated with the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, ACE2 protein which facilitates the host-cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 using the spike protein, are highly expressed in individuals with abnormal level of thyroid hormone. Altogether, we report that the malfunction of thyroid hormone synthesis may aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus monitoring the thyroid hormone may help in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.</snippet>

      <title>Is microvascular dysfunction a systemic disorder with common biomarkers found in the heart, brain, and kidneys? - A scoping review.</title>
      <snippet>Although microvascular dysfunction (MVD) has been well characterized in individual organs as different disease entities, clinical evidence is mounting in support of an underlying systemic process. To address this hypothesis, we systematically searched PubMed and Medline for studies in adults published between 2014 and 2019 that measured blood biomarkers of MVD in three vital organs i.e. brain, heart, and the kidney. Of the 9706 unique articles 321 met the criteria, reporting 49 biomarkers of which 16 were common to the three organs. Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation including reactive oxidation, immune activation, and coagulation were the commonly recognized pathways. Triglyceride, C-reactive protein, Cystatin C, homocysteine, uric acid, IL-6, NT-proBNP, thrombomodulin, von Willebrand Factor, and uric acid were increased in MVD of all three organs. In contrast, vitamin D was decreased. Adiponectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine, total cholesterol, high-density and low-density cholesterol were found to be variably increased or decreased in studies. We review the pathways underlying MVD in the three organs and summarize evidence supporting its systemic nature. This scoping review informs clinicians and researchers in the multi-system manifestation of MVD. Future work should focus on longitudinal investigations to evaluate the multi-system involvement of this disease.</snippet>

      <title>Vitamin D Metabolism and Its Role in Mineral and Bone Disorders in Chronic Kidney Disease in Humans, Dogs and Cats.</title>
      <snippet>Some differences regarding Vitamin D metabolism are described in dogs and cats in comparison with humans, which may be explained by an evolutionary drive among these species. Similarly, vitamin D is one of the most important regulators of mineral metabolism in dogs and cats, as well as in humans. Mineral metabolism is intrinsically related to bone metabolism, thus disturbances in vitamin D have been implicated in the development of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) in people, in addition to dogs and cats. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHPT), which is the most common mineral disorder in later stages of CKD in dogs and cats. Herein, we review the peculiarities of vitamin D metabolism in these species in comparison with humans, and the role of vitamin D disturbances in the development of CKD-MBD among dogs, cats, and people. Comparative studies may offer some evidence to help further research about vitamin D metabolism and bone disorders in CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Circulating Levels of Dickkopf-Related Protein 1 Decrease as Measured GFR Declines and Are Associated with PTH Levels.</title>
      <snippet>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in the development of adynamic bone disease in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are antagonists of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway yet have not been widely used as clinical indicators of bone disease. This study characterized levels of DKK1, sclerostin, and other biomarkers of mineral metabolism in participants across a spectrum of inulin-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ... GFR was measured by urinary inulin clearance (mGFR) in 90 participants. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of circulating DKK1, sclerostin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, α-klotho, and vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Spearman correlations and linear regressions were used where appropriate to examine the associations between measured values. ... The median [IQR] age was 64 years [53.0-71.0], and the median [IQR] mGFR was 32.6 [21.7-60.6] mL/min. DKK1 decreased (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.001) and sclerostin increased (r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.001) as kidney function declined, and both were associated with phosphate, PTH, FGF-23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the unadjusted analysis. After adjustment for age and mGFR, DKK1 remained significantly associated with PTH. ... The results of this study demonstrate opposing trends in Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors, DKK1 and sclerostin, as mGFR declines. Unlike sclerostin, DKK1 levels decreased significantly as mGFR declined and was independently associated with PTH. Future studies should determine whether measurement of Wnt signaling inhibitors may be useful in predicting bone histomorphometric findings and important clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.</snippet>
