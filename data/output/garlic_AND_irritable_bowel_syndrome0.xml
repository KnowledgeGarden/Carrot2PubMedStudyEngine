      <title>Herbal formula improves upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms and gut health in Australian adults with digestive disorders.</title>
      <snippet>Gastrointestinal (GI) problems affect half of Western populations. Symptoms can vary from frequent reflux to irritable bowel syndrome. The Nutrition Care (NC) Gut Relief Formula contains a combination of herbs and nutrients including curcumin, Aloe vera, slippery elm, guar gum, pectin, peppermint oil, and glutamine shown to benefit the GI system. The 16-week pre-post study tested the hypothesis that the NC Gut Relief Formula would be tolerable and effective in improving GI symptoms and gut health in adults with digestive disorders. A total of 43 participants completed the study. After a control phase, participants took 5 g/d and then 10 g/d of the formula for 4 weeks. GI symptoms and GI health were assessed by a series of validated questionnaires, for example, Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire, Bristol Stool Chart, Birmingham IBS Symptom Questionnaire, and by intestinal permeability and gut microbiota profile. The NC Gut Relief Formula significantly improved the frequency and severity of upper and lower GI symptoms by 60%-80%, including indigestion, heartburn, nausea, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal pain, and troublesome flatulence, and significantly improved physical functioning, energy levels, mood, and sleep by 60%-80%. All participants with normal stool, 90% with hard stool, and 66% with soft stool recovered from intestinal permeability, evident by normal lactulose to mannitol ratios. The NC Gut Relief Formula generally improved microbial profile, with a marked increase in Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Almost half of the participants with upper GI symptoms taking proton pump inhibitors for heartburn no longer required proton pump inhibitors at the end of the study. A third of participants were able to reintroduce food triggers, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols garlic, onion, and beans, or reflux-causing acidic/spicy foods, for example, citrus, tomato, and caffeine, in their diet after 3 months without symptom aggravation. The NC Gut Relief Formula significantly improved GI symptoms and associated quality of life over 3 months while reducing intestinal permeability, improving the microbial profile, reducing the need for reflux medication, and enabling the consumption of previous food triggers.</snippet>

      <title>Efficiency of diet change in irritable bowel syndrome.</title>
      <snippet>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habit such as constipation, diarrhea, or both. Food is one of the most commonly reported triggers of IBS symptoms. we aim to assess the effect of diet change in improving IBS. ... This study was a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was developed for data collection in the present study. The survey was distributed online in Arabic language. ...  value = 0.006). ... According to our results, the prevalence of IBS was higher among females. Some diets, especially onions, garlic, and coffee, were reported to increase the IBS symptoms. Decreasing carbohydrate diets and increasing fiber diet would enhance the patient health where the symptoms where decreased.</snippet>

      <title>The Food-Specific Serum IgG Reactivity in Major Depressive Disorder Patients, Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients and Healthy Controls.</title>
      <snippet>There is an increasing amount of evidence which links the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with food IgG hyperreactivity. Some authors have suggested that food IgG hyperreactivity could be also involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to compare levels of serum IgG against 39 selected food antigens between three groups of participants: patients with MDD (MDD group), patients with IBS (IBS group) and healthy controls (HC group). The study included 65 participants (22 in the MDD group, 22 in the IBS group and 21 in the HC group). Serum IgG levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for the analysis. IgG food hyperreactivity (interpreted as an average of levels of IgG antibodies above 7.5 &amp;micro;g/mL) was detected in 28 (43%) participants, including 14 (64%) from the MDD group, ten (46%) from the IBS group and four (19%) from the HC group. We found differences between extreme IgG levels in MDD versus HC groups and in IBS versus HC groups. Patients with MDD had significantly higher serum levels of total IgG antibodies and IgG against celery, garlic and gluten compared with healthy controls. The MDD group also had higher serum IgG levels against gluten compared with the IBS group. Our results suggest dissimilarity in immune responses against food proteins between the examined groups, with the highest immunoreactivity in the MDD group. Further studies are needed to repeat and confirm these results in bigger cohorts and also examine clinical utility of IgG-based elimination diet in patients with MDD and IBS.</snippet>

      <title>Dietary practices and FODMAPs in South Asia: Applicability of the low FODMAP diet to patients with irritable bowel syndrome.</title>
      <snippet>The low Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) diet has been described, evaluated, and found efficacious for the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome primarily in Western countries. The aim of this review was to address the applicability of this diet to South Asia. The high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South Asia and its associated effects of quality of life and economics warrant the introduction of efficacious therapies. The considerable heterogeneity of dietary patterns and methods of food preparation across South Asian countries and a paucity of food analysis limit precision in defining foods that are high or low in FODMAPs. Spices and condiments are commonly consumed and mostly have a low FODMAP content. However, major high FODMAP sources are frequently used and include onion, garlic, shallots, legumes/pulses, and wheat-based products, as well as coconut and milk products, offering an opportunity for dietary management to reduce the symptom load. The feasibility of instituting a restrictive diet in which foods with a high FODMAP content are replaced by foods low in FODMAPs must be addressed as a substantial proportion of the nutritional intake including energy, proteins, and micronutrients, is often obtained from FODMAP-rich food. Furthermore, limited knowledge of health professionals together with a paucity of dietitians further challenge the practicality of introducing the diet. Thus, while the use of the low FODMAP diet in South Asia may be more limited than in westernized countries, it does offer potential therapeutic opportunities, the efficacy, and impact of which require further investigation.</snippet>

      <title>The Low FODMAP Diet and Its Application in East and Southeast Asia.</title>
      <snippet>There is growing interest in using food choice/dietary change to influence clinical outcomes in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The low fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet is an evidence-based approach that is gaining popularity in many Western countries. The low FODMAP diet is based on restricting dietary intake of short chain carbohydrates that are slowly absorbed or indigestible and not absorbed during passage through the small intestine. These are collectively described as &quot;FODMAPs&quot; and comprise oligosaccharides (mostly fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides), sugar polyols, fructose in excess of glucose, and lactose in lactose malabsorbers. The general strategy of the diet is to avoid foods high in FODMAPs and replace them with foods low in FODMAPs, with long-term restriction limited to what is required to control symptoms. The likely mechanism of action is minimisation of the stimulation of mechanoreceptors exerted by distension of the intestinal lumen with water from osmotic effects and gases from bacterial fermentation in those with visceral hypersensitivity. The success of this dietary approach greatly depends on detailed knowledge about the FODMAP composition of food com - monly consumed in that country. While the content of foods associated with East and Southeast Asian cuisines has not been fully explored, major high FODMAP sources are frequently used and include onion, garlic, shallots, legumes/pulses, and wheat-based products. Thus, this dietary approach holds great promise in treating IBS patients in East and Southeast Asia. The aim of this review is to highlight how the diet is implemented, its efficacy, and troublesome ingredients frequently used in Asian dishes. </snippet>

      <title>In vitro effect of some Egyptian herbal extracts against Blastocystis hominis.</title>
      <snippet>Blastocystis hominis is an enteric parasite that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many animals. This emerging parasite has a worldwide distribution. It is often identified as the most common eukaryotic organism reported in human fecal samples that showed a dramatic increase in recent years. Metronidazole is the main therapy for blastocystosis. However, frequent reports of treatment failure suggesting isolates resistance to metronidazole. This study determined the growth pattern and in vitro susceptibility of B. hominis to nitazoxanide (NTZ), garlic, ginger, onion and turmeric. Fecal samples positive for Blastocystis were collected from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and processed for culture. Cultured samples were subjected to examination by light microscopy. Herbs&apos; extracts was freshly prepared. Drug susceptibility assays was done using 0.1 mg/ml of NTZ, garlic, ginger, onion and turmeric. Effects assessed on parasite culture after 24 hr. and 48 hr. Cultured fecal samples of B. hominis have identified several forms of the organism; vacuolar, granular, amoeboid and cyst forms within 24 hr. Nitazoxanide treatment significantly (P &lt; 0.001) lowered the parasite number after 48 hr. (mean, 337.5 ± 17.67) /ml. The reduction rate after 48 hr. compared to PBS was 93.33%. Ginger treatment significantly (P &lt; 0.002) lowered the number of the parasite after 48 hr. (mean, 335 ± 7.07)/ml. Moreover, garlic treatment also significantly (P &lt; 0.002) lowered the number of the parasite after 48 hr. (mean, 382.5 ± 10.60)/ml. The reduction rates after 48 hr. in these treated samples compared to PBS were 92.98% and 92.44% respectively. However, onion, and turmeric treatments insignificantly lowered the number of the parasite after 48 hr. (P &lt; 0.15 &amp; &lt; 0.22 respectively).</snippet>

      <title>In vitro sensitivity of Blastocystis hominis to garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper used in diet.</title>
      <snippet>To determine the growth pattern and in vitro susceptibility of Blastocystis hominis to metronidazole (MTZ), garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper. Stool specimens were collected from 16 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 10 controls between July-November 2010. Stool microscopy and culture for B. hominis was performed. Drug susceptibility assays was done using 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml of MTZ, garlic, ginger, white cumin, and black pepper. Effect was assessed on B. hominis culture after 48 h. Stool DNA was extracted using stool DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done using subtype-specific sequence-tagged-site primers. B. hominis genotype 3 and coinfection of 1 and 3 tended to grow well in culture compared to isolated type 1 infection. Exposed to MTZ at a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml, 38% (6/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow in culture compared to 100% (10/10) of B. hominis from control (p = 0.001). When they were exposed to MTZ at 0.1 mg/ml, 56% (9/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow in cultures compared to 100% (10/10) from control (p = 0.01). Forty-four percent (7/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow in culture compared to 100% (10/10) B. hominis from control when exposed to garlic at a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml (p = 0.003) and following exposure to garlic at 0.1 mg/ml, 38% (6/16) B. hominis from IBS did not grow in cultures compared to 100% (10/10) from control (p = 0.001). B. hominis isolates from IBS had a cell count of 6,625 at a MTZ concentration of 0.01 mg/ml that reduced to 1,250 as MTZ concentration was increased to 0.1 mg/ml (p = 0.08). B. hominis from IBS with a mean cell count of 3 × 10(5) at baseline decreased to 1 × 10(4) when exposed to garlic at 0.01 mg/ml (p &lt; 0.001) and to 1 × 10(3) (p &lt; 0.001) when garlic was 0.1 mg/ml. B. hominis from IBS cell count decreased to 1 × 10(5) when exposed to white cumin at 0.01 mg/ml (p = 0.01) and to 1 × 10(5) (p &lt; 0.001) when white cumin was 0.1 mg/ml. Exposed to black pepper at 0.1 mg/ml, cell count of B. hominis from IBS decreased to 1 × 10(5) (p = 0.01). B. hominis from IBS decreased to 1.3 × 10(5) exposed to ginger at 0.01 mg/ml (p = 0.001). B. hominis isolates were mostly genotypes 3, type 1 and 3 coinfection, and non-typeable B. hominis isolates. B. hominis isolates from IBS mostly genotype 1 demonstrated an increased sensitivity to garlic at 0.01 mg/ml with a B. hominis cell count of 3,714 compared to 6,142 when exposed to 0.01 mg/ml of MTZ. However, this sensitivity did not increase as garlic concentration was increased to 0.1 mg/ml, for B. hominis cell count was 6,000 compared to 1,428 as MTZ was increased to 0.1 mg/ml.</snippet>
