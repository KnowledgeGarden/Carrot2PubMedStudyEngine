      <snippet>Fibrosis is a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix as a response to different types of tissue injuries, which leads to organ dysfunction. The process can be initiated by multiple and different stimuli and pathogenic factors which trigger the cascade of reparation converging in molecular signals responsible of initiating and driving fibrosis. Though fibrosis can play a defensive role, in several circumstances at a certain stage, it can progressively become an uncontrolled irreversible and self-maintained process, named pathological fibrosis. Several systems, molecules and responses involved in the pathogenesis of the pathological fibrosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be discussed in this review, putting special attention on inflammation, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Klotho, microRNAs (miRs), and the vitamin D hormonal system. All of them are key factors of the core and regulatory pathways which drive fibrosis, having a great negative kidney and cardiac impact in CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Pathological calcification is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidities primarily in population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal diseases (ERSD) and metabolic disorders. Investigators have accepted the fact that vascular calcification is not a passive process but a highly complex, cell mediated, active process in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulting from, metabolic insults of bone fragility, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Over the years, studies have revealed various mechanisms of vascular calcification like induction of bone formation, apoptosis, alteration in Ca-P balance and loss of inhibition. Novel clinical studies targeting cellular mechanisms of calcification provide promising and potential avenues for drug development. The interventions include phosphate binders, sodium thiosulphate, vitamin K, calcimimetics, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, Myoinositol hexaphosphate (IP6), Denosumab and TNAP inhibitors. Concurrently investigators are also working towards reversing or curing pathological calcification. This review focuses on the relationship of vascular calcification to clinical diseases, regulators and factors causing calcification including genetics which have been identified. At present, there is lack of any significant preventive measures for calcifications and hence this review explores further possibilities for drug development and treatment modalities.</snippet>

      <snippet>Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing dialysis. Renal osteodystrophy, which describes an alteration of bone morphology, is an important component of this systemic disorder and may explain the elevated risk of fracture which adversely affects morbidity and mortality. The most common form of renal osteodystrophy is high-turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa), which is induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). During the past decade, there has been considerable advances in the management of SHPT, with the introduction of the calcimimetic agents, the optimized use of nutritional and active vitamin D, and the accumulated experience with surgical parathyroidectomy. Studies supported that these advances could translate into improvement of renal bone disease and fracture prevention, as well as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. In this review, we summarize the available clinical evidence on the effect of old and new drugs on bone disorders in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Some differences regarding Vitamin D metabolism are described in dogs and cats in comparison with humans, which may be explained by an evolutionary drive among these species. Similarly, vitamin D is one of the most important regulators of mineral metabolism in dogs and cats, as well as in humans. Mineral metabolism is intrinsically related to bone metabolism, thus disturbances in vitamin D have been implicated in the development of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) in people, in addition to dogs and cats. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHPT), which is the most common mineral disorder in later stages of CKD in dogs and cats. Herein, we review the peculiarities of vitamin D metabolism in these species in comparison with humans, and the role of vitamin D disturbances in the development of CKD-MBD among dogs, cats, and people.

      <snippet>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in the development of adynamic bone disease in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are antagonists of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway yet have not been widely used as clinical indicators of bone disease. This study characterized levels of DKK1, sclerostin, and other biomarkers of mineral metabolism in participants across a spectrum of inulin-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ... GFR was measured by urinary inulin clearance (mGFR) in 90 participants. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of circulating DKK1, sclerostin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, α-klotho, and vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Spearman correlations and linear regressions were used where appropriate to examine the associations between measured values. ... The median [IQR] age was 64 years [53.0-71.0], and the median [IQR] mGFR was 32.6 [21.7-60.6] mL/min. DKK1 decreased (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.001) and sclerostin increased (r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.001) as kidney function declined, and both were associated with phosphate, PTH, FGF-23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the unadjusted analysis. After adjustment for age and mGFR, DKK1 remained significantly associated with PTH. ... The results of this study demonstrate opposing trends in Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors, DKK1 and sclerostin, as mGFR declines. Unlike sclerostin, DKK1 levels decreased significantly as mGFR declined and was independently associated with PTH. Future studies should determine whether measurement of Wnt signaling inhibitors may be useful in predicting bone histomorphometric findings and important clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>The bone-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) acts in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol in the regulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) homeostasis. More factors are being identified to regulate FGF23 levels and the endocrine loops between the three hormones. The present review summarizes the complex regulation of FGF23 and the disturbed FGF23/Klotho system in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to the reduced ability of the injured kidney to regulate plasma levels of FGF23, several CKD-related factors have been shown to stimulate FGF23 production. The high circulating FGF23 levels have detrimental effects on erythropoiesis, the cardio-vascular system and the immune system, all contributing to the disturbed system biology in CKD. Moreover, new factors secreted by the injured kidney and the uremic calcified vasculature play a role in the mineral and bone disorder in CKD and create a vicious pathological crosstalk.</snippet>

      <snippet>Hereditary hypophosphatemic disorders, TIO, and CKD conditions are believed to be influenced by an excess of Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF-23) which activates a binary renal FGFRs / α-Klotho complex to regulate homeostatic metabolism of phosphate and vitamin D. Adaptive FGF-23 responses from CKD patients with excess FGF-23 frequently lead to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. A reversibly binding small molecule therapeutic has yet to emerge from research and development in this area. Current outcomes described in this work highlight efforts related to lead identification and modification using organic synthesis of strategic analogues to probe structure-activity relationships and preliminarily define the pharmacophore of a computationally derived hit obtained from virtual high-throughput screening. Synthetic strategies for the initial hit and analogue preparation, as well as preliminary cellular in vitro assay results highlighting sub micromolar inhibition of the FGF-23 signaling sequence at a concentration well below cytotoxicity are reported herein.</snippet>

      <snippet>Hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized in pediatric patients and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. In CKD, enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption is a leading cause of HTN due to augmented extracellular fluid volume expansion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) upregulates various tubular sodium cotransporters that are also targets of the hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its co-receptor Klotho. FGF23 inhibits the activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that is a potent suppressor of renin biosynthesis. Here we review the complex interactions and disturbances of the FGF23-Klotho axis, vitamin D, and the RAAS relevant to blood pressure regulation and discuss the therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating their pathophysiologic contributions to HTN.</snippet>

      <snippet>Conflicting data exists as to whether vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRa) are protective of arterial calcification. Confounding this, is the inherent physiological differences between human and animal experimental models and our current fragmented understanding of arterial vitamin D metabolism, their alterations in disease states and responses to VDRa&apos;s. Herein, the study aims to address these problems by leveraging frontiers in human arterial organ culture models. Human arteries were collected from a total of 24 patients (healthy controls, n = 12; end-stage CKD, n = 12). Cross-sectional and interventional studies were performed using arterial organ cultures treated with normal and calcifying (containing 5mmol/L CaCl2 and 5mmol/L β-glycerophosphate) medium, ex vivo. To assess the role of VDRa therapy, arteries were treated with either calcitriol or paricalcitol. We found that human arteries express a functionally active vitamin D system, including the VDR, 1α-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) components and these were dysregulated in CKD arteries. VDRa therapy increased VDR expression in healthy arteries (p&lt;0.01) but not in CKD arteries. Arterial 1α-OHase (p&lt;0.05) and 24-OHase mRNA and protein expression were modulated differentially in healthy and CKD arteries by VDRa therapy. VDRa exposure suppressed Runx2 and MMP-9 expression in CKD arteries, however only paricalcitol suppressed MMP-2. VDRa exposure did not modulate arterial calcification in all organ culture models. However, VDRa reduced expression of senescence associated β-galactosidase (SAβG) staining in human aortic-smooth muscle cells under calcifying conditions, in vitro. In conclusion, maladaptation of arterial vitamin D signaling components occurs in CKD. VDRa exposure can exert vasculo-protective effects and seems critical for the regulation of arterial health in CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>The key players of the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are calcium, phosphate, PTH, FGF23, and the vitamin D hormonal system. The progressive reduction of kidney function greatly modifies the tightly interrelated mechanisms that control these parameters. As a result, important changes occur in the bone and mineral hormonal axis, leading to changes in bone turnover with relevant consequences in clinical outcomes, such as decrease in bone mass with increased bone fragility and bone fractures and increased vascular and valvular calcification, also with great impact in the cardiovascular outcomes.

      <snippet>Background Sclerostin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are new markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mediated mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) which were extensively evaluated in adult population. We aimed to evaluate the associations between serum levels of sclerostin/OPG and parameters of bone turnover and compare the serum levels of sclerostin/OPG in different stages of CKD in children. Methods 70 children with CKD stage 1-5, aged 2-21 years were examined. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, total calcium, phosphorus , intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and vitamin D were measured. Serum sclerostin and OPG levels were measured in children with different levels of CKD stage and their association with bone turnover parameters were noted. Results We did not observe any significant correlation between serum levels of sclerostin and OPG and stages of CKD. A negative relationship was present between serum sclerostin and 25-OH vitamin D levels. Osteoprotegerin was positively and significantly correlated with ALP but serum sclerostin was negatively correlated with ALP. Conclusion Our study, which includes only children and adolescents with a growing skeleton under uremic conditions and excluding diabetes and atherosclerosis interference, is very valuable. We couldn&apos;t find any significant relationship between either sclerostin or OPG levels among different stages of CKD. Also our study demonstared a strong negative relationship between ALP and sclerostin levels and a strong positive relationship between ALP and OPG levels, reminding the importance of ALP levels to predict the bone-mineral status of the children with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been typically implicated in cardiovascular risk, considering the function the kidney has related to blood pressure, vitamin D, red blood cell metabolism, and electrolyte and acid-base regulation. However, neurological consequences are also attributed to this disease. Among these, recent large epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased risk for Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) in patients with CKD. Multiple studies have evaluated individually the association of blood pressure, vitamin D, and red blood cell dysmetabolism with PD, however, no study has reviewed the potential mechanisms related to these components in context of CKD and PD. In this review, we explored the association of CKD and PD and linked the components of the former to propose potential pathways explaining a future increased risk for PD, where renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and inflammation have a main role. Potential preventive and therapeutic interventions based on these associations are also explored. More preclinical studies are needed to confirm the potential link of CKD conditions and future PD risk, whereas more interventional studies targeting this association are warranted to confirm their potential benefit in PD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Klotho has been recognized as a gene involved in the aging process in mammals for over 30 years, where it regulates phosphate homeostasis and the activity of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. The α-Klotho protein is the receptor for Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23), regulating phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism. Phosphate toxicity is a hallmark of mammalian aging and correlates with diminution of Klotho levels with increasing age. As such, modulation of Klotho activity is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in the diseasome of aging; in particular for chronic kidney disease (CKD), where Klotho has been implicated directly in the pathophysiology. A range of senotherapeutic strategies have been developed to directly or indirectly influence Klotho expression, with varying degrees of success. These include administration of exogenous Klotho, synthetic and natural Klotho agonists and indirect approaches, via modulation of the foodome and the gut microbiota. All these approaches have significant potential to mitigate loss of physiological function and resilience accompanying old age and to improve outcomes within the diseasome of aging.</snippet>

The impact of n-oxPTH and oxPTH on FGF23 synthesis, however, and how n-oxPTH and oxPTH concentrations are affected by CKD, is yet unknown. The effects of oxidized and non-oxidized PTH 1-34 on Fgf23 gene expression were analyzed in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between n-oxPTH and oxPTH, respectively, with FGF23 in two independent patients&apos; cohorts (620 children with CKD and 600 kidney transplant recipients). While n-oxPTH stimulated Fgf23 mRNA synthesis in vitro, oxidation of PTH in particular at Met8 led to a markedly weaker stimulation of Fgf23. The effect was even stronger when both Met8 and Met18 were oxidized. In both clinical cohorts, n-oxPTH-but not oxPTH-was significantly associated with FGF23 concentrations, independent of known confounding factors. Moreover, with progressive deterioration of kidney function, intact PTH (iPTH) and oxPTH increased substantially, whereas n-oxPTH increased only moderately. In conclusion, n-oxPTH, but not oxPTH, stimulates Fgf23 gene expression. The increase in PTH with decreasing GFR is mainly due to an increase in oxPTH in more advanced stages of CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the development of mineral bone disorder (MBD), osteoporosis, and fragility fractures. Among CKD patients, adynamic bone disease or low bone turnover is the most common type of renal osteodystrophy. The consequences of CKD-MBD include increased fracture risk, greater morbidity, and mortality. Thus, the goal is to prevent the occurrences of fractures by means of alleviating CKD-induced MBD and treating subsequent osteoporosis. Changes in mineral and humoral metabolism as well as bone structure develop early in the course of CKD. CKD-MBD includes abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and/or vitamin D; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; and/or vascular or other soft tissue calcification. In patients with CKD-MBD, using either DXA or FRAX to screen fracture risk should be considered. Biomarkers such as bALP and iPTH may assist to assess bone turnover. Before initiating an antiresorptive or anabolic agent to treat osteoporosis in CKD patients, lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake are important. Managing hyperphosphatemia and SHPT are also crucial. Understanding the complex pathogenesis of CKD-MBD is crucial in improving one&apos;s short- and long-term outcomes. Treatment strategies for CKD-associated osteoporosis should be patient-centered to determine the type of renal osteodystrophy. This review focuses on the mechanism, evaluation and management of patients with CKD-MBD. However, further studies are needed to explore more details regarding the underlying pathophysiology and to assess the safety and efficacy of agents for treating CKD-MBD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vascular calcification is an important risk factor for the mortality and morbidity in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, until now there is no certain medication targeting vascular calcification in CKD. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of celastrol on high calcium-induced vascular calcification and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation assay showed that celastrol inhibited aortic valve interstitial cell (VIC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation when its concentration was higher than 0.6 μmol/L. 0.8 μmol/L celastrol inhibited the expression of osteogenic genes and calcium deposition induced by high-calcium medium in both AVICs and VSMCs. In mouse vascular calcification model induced by adenine combined with vitamin D, alizarin red and immunostaining showed that celastrol inhibited pro-calcification gene expression and calcium deposition in aortic wall and aortic valve tissues. At the molecular level, celastrol inhibited the increase of BMP2, phosphorylated Smad1/5 (p-Smad1/5) and non-phosphorylated β-catenin (n-p-β-catenin) induced by high-calcium medium both in vitro and in vivo. Also, BMP2 overexpression reversed the anti-calcification effects of celastrol by recovering the decrease of p-Smad1/5 and n-p-β-catenin. Furthermore, celastrol prevented the up-regulation of BMPRII and down-regulation of Smad6 induced by high calcium, and this protectory effect can be abolished by BMP2 overexpression. In conclusion, our data for the first time demonstrate that celastrol attenuates high calcium-induced arterial and valvular calcification by inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5 signalling, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for arterial and valvular calcification in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex pathology that develops as chronic kidney disease progresses. The retention of phosphorus and the reductions in calcium and vitamin D levels stimulate the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone as well as the proliferation rate of parathyroid cells. Parathyroid growth is initially diffuse but it becomes nodular as the disease progresses, making the gland less susceptible to be inhibited. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism are well known, new evidence has shed light on unknown aspects of the deregulation of parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important feature of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and plays an important role in the development of bone disease and vascular calcification. Thus, part of the management of chronic kidney disease relies on maintaining acceptable levels of mineral metabolism parameters in an attempt to slow down or prevent the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Here, we will also review the latest evidence regarding several aspects of the clinical and surgical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</snippet>

Furthermore, repletion of vitamin D improved skeletal muscle fiber size and in vivo muscle function, normalized muscle collagen content and attenuated muscle fat infiltration as well as pathogenetic molecular pathways related to muscle mass regulation in CKD mice. RNAseq analysis was performed on the gastrocnemius muscle. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the top 12 differentially expressed genes in CKD were correlated with impaired muscle and neuron regeneration, enhanced muscle thermogenesis and fibrosis. Importantly, vitamin D repletion normalized the expression of those 12 genes in CKD mice.

More recently, additional factors have been found to play a role in vascular calcification. Matrix G1a protein (MGP) in its carboxylated form (cMGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Importantly, carboxylation of MGP is dependent on the cofactor vitamin K. In patients with CKD, vitamin K deficiency is prevalent and is exacerbated by warfarin, which is frequently used for anticoagulation. Insufficient bioavailability of vitamin K reduces the amount of cMGP available, and, therefore, it may lead to increased risk of vascular calcification. In vitro studies have shown that in the setting of a high-phosphate environment and vitamin K antagonism, human aortic valve interstitial cells become calcified. In this article, we discuss the pathophysiological consequence of vitamin K deficiency in the setting of altered mineral and bone metabolism, its prevalence, and clinical implications in patients with CKD.</snippet>

Endothelial dysfunction is a threat to the integrity of the vascular system, and it is pivotal in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with this disturbance being almost universal in patients who reach the most advanced phase of CKD, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Low NO bioavailability in CKD depends on several mechanisms affecting the expression and the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of eNOS, inflammation and oxidative stress, advanced glycosylation products (AGEs), bone mineral balance disorders encompassing hyperphosphatemia, high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and low levels of the active form of vitamin D (1,25 vitamin D) and the anti-ageing vasculoprotective factor Klotho all impinge upon NO bioavailability and are critical to endothelial dysfunction in CKD.

A significant albeit less important inhibitory effect of KP2326 on osteoclastic differentiation was also found both in cells derived from HD and CKD patients, through a putative activation of the Erk pathway. This inhibitory effect was not modified by CKD stage. Combinatorial treatment with 1.25-D and KP2326 did not result in synergistic effects. Last, KP2326 significantly inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Both 1.25-D and KP2326 inhibit osteoclastic differentiation, however, to a different extent. There is a progressive resistance to 1.25-D in advanced CKD that is not found with KP2326. KP2326 also inhibits bone resorption. Given that 1.25-D has no effect on osteoclastic resorption activity and that calcimimetics also have direct anabolic effects on osteoblasts, there is an experimental rationale that could favor the use of decreased doses of 1.25-D with low doses of calcimimetics in SHPT in dialysis to improve the underlying osteodystrophy. However, this last point deserves confirmatory clinical studies. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</snippet>

      <snippet>The aim of the work was to assess the dynamics of ultrasound parameters of renal blood flow in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)and initial stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) during treatment with inactive vitamin D. The study included 264 patients with COPD of 2-4 degrees of severity in combination with CKD of 1-2 stages: 135 patients of the main group and 129 patients of the control group. Each group was divided into 4 subgroups according to the value of FEV1 and vitamin D level. In the main group, the native vitamin D was prescribed according to the scheme providing maintenance of vitamin D level &gt;34,3 ng/ml during the year, in the control group - according to the recommendations of the Russian Association of Endocrinologists. An ultrasound of the kidneys with the calculation of the resistance index (RI) and albuminuria level were carried out in all patients at inclusion into the study and after its completion. A decrease in the severity of albuminuria from A3 to A2 was revealed in 24,1% (16), and an increase in GFR - in 42,9% (58) patients of all patients in the main group. A statistically significant decrease in the renal artery resistance index was recorded in the group of patients with moderate COPD (GOLD 2) and vitamin D deficiency in the main group (p&lt;0,05). The maintaining of vitamin D levels more than 34,3 ng/ml over 12 months in patients with COPD in combination with CKD stage 1-2 was associated with a decrease in the severity of albuminuria, with an increase in GFR, and statistically significant decrease of resistance index in renal arteries of patients with moderate clinical course of COPD (GOLD 2) and lack of vitamin D.</snippet>

Our data suggest that the true hypocalcemia incidence after using albumin-corrected calcium values is very low in patients receiving IPCI, even in the presence of calcium altering factors. The percentage of patients with hypocalcemia is much higher and similar to the KEYNOTE-189 and CHECKMATE-067 trials when serum calcium values without albumin correction are used. Thus, the higher reported incidence of hypocalcemia in these trials is likely due to the reporting of serum calcium without albumin correction.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic itch (CI) is the most common symptom in dermatology. It is considered a great burden with a large impact on patients&apos; quality of life, interfering with everyday activities. During the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD) many patients develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD)-associated CI (ESRDCI). Its pathogenesis is yet to be fully explained, but multiple mechanisms have been described, including, among others, dysregulation of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D axis, microinflammation, and accumulation of uremic toxins. The treatment consists of both topical and systemic therapy, but unfortunately it is usually difficult and unsatisfactory. Renal transplantation (KTx) as the best renal replacement therapy improves considerably the patient&apos;s life quality and decreases the mortality rate. However, its influence on CI has not been well described. In this review, we presented the available literature on the influence of KTx on ESRDCI and demonstrated the possible ways in which transplanted kidney could help patients suffering from CI.</snippet>

      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that correlates with morbidity and mortality in uremic patients. It is characterized by high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and impaired bone and mineral metabolism. The main mechanisms underlying SHP are increased PTH biosynthesis and secretion as well as increased glandular mass. The mechanisms leading to parathyroid cell proliferation in SHP are not fully understood. Reduced expressions of the receptors for calcium and vitamin D contribute to the disinhibition of parathyroid cell proliferation. Activation of transforming growth factor-α-epidermal growth factor receptor (TGF-α-EGFR), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), and cyclooxygenase 2- prostaglandin E2 (Cox2-PGE2) signaling all correlate with parathyroid cell proliferation, underlining their roles in the development of SHP. In addition, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is activated in parathyroid glands of experimental SHP rats. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevents and corrects the increased parathyroid cell proliferation of SHP. Mice with parathyroid-specific deletion of all miRNAs have a muted increase in serum PTH and fail to increase parathyroid cell proliferation when challenged by CKD, suggesting that miRNA is also necessary for the development of SHP. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the mechanisms of parathyroid cell proliferation in SHP.</snippet>

An experimental CKD model was used to determine whether altering the calcitriol delivery profile to obtain different PTH suppression levels could improve vascular health outcomes. High adenine diet (0.25%) was used to generate experimental CKD in rats. CKD rats were treated using different calcitriol dosing strategies: (a) 20 ng/kg SD (n = 8), (b) 80 ng/kg SD (n = 8), (c) 5 ng/kg QID (n = 9), or (d) 20 ng/kg QID (n = 9). Multiple targets of calcitriol were assessed which include arterial calcium and phosphate as well as circulating calcium, phosphate, PTH, FGF-23, VWF, and vitamin D metabolome. PTH suppression occurred dose-dependently after 1-week calcitriol treatment (P &lt; .01), but the suppressive effect was lost over time. Both VC and circulating FGF-23 increased &gt; 10× in all calcitriol-treated rats (P &lt; .05 and P &lt; .001, respectively); similarly, circulating VWF increased at all time points (P &lt; .05). Ad-hoc analysis of CKD morbidities in treated rats indicated no differences in negative outcomes based on PTH suppression level (minimal-, target-, and over-). Comparing different calcitriol dosing strategies revealed the following: (a) despite initial calcitriol-influenced PTH suppression across all treatments, the ability to continually suppress PTH was markedly reduced by study conclusion and (b) PTH suppression level is not an adequate proxy for improvements in overall CKD morbidity. These findings show (a) a more holistic approach to evaluate CKD treatment efficacy aside from PTH suppression is needed and (b) that other VDRA therapies should be examined in CKD treatment.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a higher risk of cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. The links between CKD and CVD are not fully elucidated but encompass both traditional and uremic-related risk factors. The term CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) indicates a systemic disorder characterized by abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH and FGF-23, along with vitamin D deficiency, decreased bone mineral density or altered bone turnover and vascular calcification. A growing body of evidence shows that CKD patients can be affected by subclinical vitamin K deficiency; this has led to identifying such a condition as a potential therapeutic target given the specific role of Vitamin K in metabolism of several proteins involved in bone and vascular health. In other words, we can hypothesize that vitamin K deficiency is the common pathogenetic link between impaired bone mineralization and vascular calcification. However, some of the most common approaches to CKD, such as (1) low vitamin K intake due to nutritional restrictions, (2) warfarin treatment, (3) VDRA and calcimimetics, and (4) phosphate binders, may instead have the opposite effects on vitamin K metabolism and storage in CKD patients.</snippet>

In end-stage renal disease, this response becomes maladaptive and high levels of phosphorus may occur. We summarize strategies to control hyperphosphatemia based on a systematic literature review of clinical trial and real-world observational data on phosphorus control in hemodialysis patients with CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). These studies suggest that current management options (diet and lifestyle changes; regular dialysis treatment; and use of phosphate binders, vitamin D, calcimimetics) have their own benefits and limitations with variable clinical outcomes.

      <snippet>Objectives Kidney transplant (KTx) recipients frequently have deficient or insufficient levels of serum vitamin D. Few studies have investigated the effect of cholecalciferol in these patients. We evaluated the efficacy of weekly cholecalciferol administration on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in stable KTx patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1-3. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 48 stable KTx recipients (37 males, 11 females, aged 52 ± 11 years and 26 months post-transplantation) were treated weekly with oral cholecalciferol (7500-8750 IU) for 12 months and compared to 44 untreated age- and gender-matched recipients. Changes in levels of PTH, 25(OH) vitamin D (25[OH]D), serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results At baseline, clinical characteristics were similar between treated and untreated patients. Considering the entire cohort, 87 (94.6%) were deficient in vitamin D and 64 (69.6%) had PTH ≥130 pg/mL. Serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine and eGFR did not differ between groups over the follow-up period. However, 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher at both 6 (63.5 vs. 30.3 nmol/L, p &lt; 0.001) and 12 months (69.4 vs. 30 nmol/L, p &lt; 0.001) in treated vs. untreated patients, corresponding with a significant reduction in PTH at both 6 (112 vs. 161 pg/mL) and 12 months (109 vs. 154 pg/mL) in treated vs. untreated patients, respectively (p &lt; 0.001 for both). Conclusions Weekly administration of cholecalciferol can significantly and stably reduce PTH levels, without any adverse effects on serum calcium and renal function.</snippet>

In 1276 incident PD patients (median age 50 years, 56% males), baseline serum ALP, iPTH, and metabolic biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were analyzed in relation to mortality during follow-up period of up to 60 months. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk of ALP and iPTH were analyzed with competing-risks regression models with transplantation as competing risk adjusting for all covariates. ... After adjustments for confounders by logistic regression model, older age, higher change level to levels of iPTH, S-albumin, calcium, alanine transaminase (ALT), and lower level of phosphorus were associated with higher ALP level (&gt;79 U/L), and female gender, non-diabetes mellitus, younger age, lower calcium, higher ALT, total bilirubin, phosphorus, and ALP were associated with higher iPTH level (&gt;300 pg/mL). During 60 months (median 44 months) of follow-up, the all-cause mortality rate was 16%, and 91 (46%) of the 199 deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease. In competing-risks regression analysis, &quot;high ALP + low iPTH&quot; was independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, gender, presence of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, the calendar year of recruitment and vitamin D therapy in PD patients. The subhazard ratio (sHR) of group &quot;high ALP + low iPTH&quot; was 1.96 times and 3.35 times higher than sHR of group &quot;low ALP + high iPTH&quot; for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. ... The combination of high ALP and low iPTH was independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients, suggesting that ALP and iPTH have the potential to predict clinical outcomes and might be useful risk assessment tools in PD patients. Further studies exploring the observed association between combination of ALP with iPTH and mortality are warranted.</snippet>

Calcitriol was administered in two doses : 0.01 µg/mL/100 gramsBW/day (SND1 group; n=6) and 0.05 µg/mL/100 gramsBW/day (SND2 group; n=6) intraperitoneally for 14 days. Glomerulosclerosis and tubular injury score were examined using PAS staining, meanwhile, interstitial fibrosis area fraction was assessed with Sirius Red staining. RT-PCR was performed for assessing nephrin, podocin, IL-6, CD68, Collagen-1, and TGF-β1 mRNA expressions. Immunostaining (IHC) was carried out to observe macrophage (CD68) and myofibroblast (α-SMA). SN demonstrated CKD condition with higher tubular injury, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation compared to SO. Calcitriol-treated group (especially SND2) demonstrated significant lower tubular injury, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis compared to SN. SND2 group showed not only significantly lower CD68, IL-6, Collagen-1, and TGF-β1 mRNA expressions, but also higher mRNA expressions of nephrin and podocin. SND2 group also demonstrated reduction of macrophages infiltration and myofibroblasts expansion based on its histopathological appearance. Vitamin D may have a renoprotective effect on 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy model by attenuating podocytopathy, tubular injury, inflammation and interstitial fibrosis.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vitamin D is tightly linked with renal tubular homeostasis: the mitochondria of proximal convoluted tubule cells are the production site of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Patients with renal impairment or tubular injury often suffer from chronic inflammation. This alteration comes from oxidative stress, acidosis, decreased clearance of inflammatory cytokines and stimulation of inflammatory factors. The challenge is to find the right formula for each patient to correctly modulate the landscape of treatment and preserve the essential functions of the organism without perturbating its homeostasis. The complexity of the counter-regulation mechanisms and the different axis involved in the Vitamin D equilibrium pose a major issue on Vitamin D as a potential effective anti-inflammatory drug. The therapeutic use of this compound should be able to inhibit the development of inflammation without interfering with normal homeostasis. Megalin-Cubilin-Amnionless and the FGF23-Klotho axis represent two Vitamin D-linked mechanisms that could modulate and ameliorate the damage response at the renal tubular level, balancing Vitamin D therapy with an effect potent enough to contrast the inflammatory cascades, but which avoids potential severe side effects.</snippet>

      <snippet>Background The optimal timing of treatment with vitamin D therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), vitamin D insufficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a pressing question in nephrology with economic and patient outcome implications. Objective The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of earlier vitamin D treatment in CKD patients not on dialysis with vitamin D insufficiency and SHPT. Design A cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Markov model of CKD progression was developed from the Medicare perspective. The model follows a hypothetical cohort of 1000 Stage 3 or 4 CKD patients over a 5-year time horizon. The intervention was vitamin D therapy initiated in CKD stages 3 or 4 through CKD stage 5/end-stage renal disease (ESRD) versus initiation in CKD stage 5/ESRD only. The outcomes of interest were cardiovascular (CV) events averted, fractures averted, time in CKD stage 5/ESRD, mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs associated with clinical events and CKD stage. Results Vitamin D treatment in CKD stages 3 and 4 was a dominant strategy when compared to waiting to treat until CKD stage 5/ESRD. Total cost savings associated with treatment during CKD stages 3 and 4, compared to waiting until CKD stage 5/ESRD, was estimated to be $19.9 million. The model estimated that early treatment results in 159 averted CV events, 5 averted fractures, 269 fewer patient-years in CKD stage 5, 41 fewer deaths, and 191 additional QALYs. Conclusions Initiating vitamin D therapy in CKD stages 3 or 4 appears to be cost-effective, largely driven by the annual costs of care by CKD stage, CV event costs, and risks of hypercalcemia. Further research demonstrating causal relationships between vitamin D therapy and patient outcomes is needed to inform decision making regarding vitamin D therapy timing.</snippet>

Severe hypercalcemia (15.3 mg/dL) was found and he was hospitalized. Fluids, loop diuretics and glucocorticoids were administered intravenously, which partially reduced calcium levels over a few days and improved his clinical condition. PTH levels proved increased (306 pg/mL) and 25-OHD levels were reduced; primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was diagnosed. Neck ultrasonography (USG) did not show parathyroid enlargement, nor did 99mTechnetium-sestamibi (SESTAMIBI) scintigraphy reveal hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. By contrast, 18F-choline PET/CT evidenced a nodule located close to the oesophagus, behind the right thyroid lobe, which proved compatible with a hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland. Since the patient declined surgery, and zoledronate was unfit owing to areas of rarefaction of the jaw, the calcimimetic cinacalcet was started; the dosage was progressively titrated up to 120 mg/day with normalisation of calcium levels over time. PTH levels, however, proved erratic and showed an upward trend over the first year of therapy; however its levels partially decreased following increase of vitamin D levels by replacement therapy. Cinacalcet is a useful and safe drug, which can normalise calcium levels and improve the clinical condition, even in very old patients with severe PHPT who decline or are unfit for surgery.</snippet>

The impact of CKD-MBD may be immediate with abnormalities of bone and mineral metabolism with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased FGF23 levels, or delayed with poor growth, bone deformities, fractures, and vascular calcifications, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The global management of CKD-MBD has been detailed in international guidelines for adults and children, however, with difficulties to obtain an agreement on the ideal PTH targets. The clinical management of hyperphosphatemia is a daily challenge for nephrologists and pediatric nephrologists, notably because of the phosphate overload in occidental diets that is mainly due to the phosphate &quot;hidden&quot; in food additives. The management begins with a dietary restriction of phosphate intake, and is followed by the use of calcium-based and non-calcium-based phosphate binders, and/or the intensification of dialysis. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of hyperphosphatemia in CKD, with a focus on its deleterious effects and a description of the clinical management of hyperphosphatemia in a more global setting of CKD-MBD.</snippet>

Deficiency of 25-vitamin D, often found in patients with CKD, has been included as an inflammatory factor since it might modulate the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of 25-vitamin D on inflammatory pathways in healthy and uremic environment. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), oxidative stress (ROS), vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1-α hydroxylase (CYP27), 24 hydroxylase, cathelicidin, and MCP-1 were evaluated in monocytes exposed to a uremic serum pool compared with healthy pool. The human monocytes lineage (U937) was incubated with or without 25-vitamin D (50 ng/ml for 24 hours). TRL4, VDR, CYP27, CYP24, and ROS were evaluated by flow cytometry. We used ELISA to measure IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, cathelicidin, and MCP-1 in the cell culture supernatant. We observed a higher expression of TRL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, cathelicidin and MCP-1 in monocytes incubated with uremic serum when compared with serum from healthy individuals. Supplementation of 25-vitamin D was able to reduce the expression of TRL4, cathelicidin, and MCP-1 in the uremic environment. There was no difference in the expression of VDR, CYP27 and CYP24 intracellular enzymes. This in vitro study showed that the uremic pool activates inflammatory response in monocytes, which was reversed by 25-vitamin D supplementation; this finding suggests that 25-vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory role in the uremic environment.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in pediatric nephrology. The 2017 European guidelines recommend keeping 25OH vitamin D (25-D) levels within the 75-120 nmol/L range, ideally with daily supplementation. Intermittent supplementation with D3 has also been proposed. We aimed to assess the influence of our local protocol of intermittent vitamin D supplementation on the evolution of 25-D levels between baseline and 2 months. VITATOL is a prospective single-center study performed in our tertiary unit in children and teenagers followed for chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney transplantation, or stable chronic nephrotic syndrome with 25-D levels below 75 nmol/L. Intermittent oral cholecalciferol (100,000 IU) was administered depending on baseline vitamin D levels and body weight. The primary outcome was the change in 25-D levels between baseline and 2 months. Secondary outcomes were the evolution of the main mineral biomarkers. Thirty-seven patients were included. Two months after beginning supplementation, corresponding to a median(min-max) of 46 (14-79) days after the last dose of vitamin D, 25-D levels increased from 50 to 76 nmol/L (p &lt; 0.001), 18 patients having 25-D levels within the target range and 2 above. All patients displayed 25-D levels above 50 nmol/L. There were no significant changes in phosphate, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and FGF23 levels before and after supplementation. Calcium levels increased from 2.39 to 2.44 mmol/L (p = 0.017), but no differences in calciuria and urinary calcium/creatinine ratio were observed.Conclusion: This vitamin D supplementation protocol using intermittent moderate doses of cholecalciferol seems efficient in 54% of cases, with neither significant overdose nor hypercalciuria. What is Known: • Vitamin D deficiency is frequent in pediatric nephrology. • The 2017 European guidelines recommend keeping 25OH vitamin D levels within the 75-120 nmol/L range ideally with daily supplementation, but intermittent supplementation with D3 has also been proposed.

Vildagliptin and vitamin D3 reversed hyperuricemia and exerted a plethora of renal anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects. Our study has introduced a new insight into the role of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition and silent information regulator 1/5&apos;adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation in the nephroprotective effects of either agent, elucidating their possible crosstalk with renin angiotensin aldosterone system downregulation. Considering the superadditive renoprotective effects evoked by the combination, vitamin D3 is worth being further investigated as an additional therapeutic agent for preventing IR-induced nephropathy.</snippet>

Beside histopathology of the obtained arterial samples, all these cases were examined for body mass index (BMI), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (AP), serum albumin, uric acid (UA), alanine transaminase (ALT), parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF23), interleukin 6 (IL6), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) vit D), hemoglobin concentration, and serum ferritin. ... 86 (50%) of the cases had AC; 11 of them were in SN group (19%), 9 in HBV group (18.8%) and all the 66 HCV group (100%). In SN group, 4 had intimal calcification, 5 had medial calcification, and 2 had both intimal and medial calcification. In HBV group, 9 had intimal calcification, while no cases were encountered with either medial or both site calcifications. In HCV group, 16 had intimal calcification, 31 had medial calcification, and 19 had both intimal and medial calcification. Calcification was in the form of spots in one case in SN group, and 6 cases in HBV group, a single plaque of calcification in 5 cases of SN group, 3 cases of HBV group, and 16 cases of HCV group, multiple plaques were detected in 4 cases in SN group, and 31 cases in HCV group, and diffuse calcification in one case in SN group, and 19 cases in HCV group. In HBV group, calcification was only detected in patients with high viremia, while all patients with low or moderate viremia were devoid of calcification. In HCV group, all patients with low viremia had intimal solitary plaque of calcification, all patients with moderate viremia had multiple plaques of medial calcification, while all patients with high viremia had diffuse intimal and medial calcification. Both groups of viral hepatitis were significantly different in comparison to SN group in either distribution or calcification score (P&lt;0.001 in all). HBV group had significantly lower serum P, CaxP and PTH in comparison to SN group (4.6±0.66 vs. 5.45±0.77mg/dL, 36.4±7.2 vs. 44.1±8.69, and 348±65.4 vs. 405.9±83.2pg/mL, P&lt;0.001, &lt;0.001, and 0.035 respectively). On the other hand, HCV group did not show any significant difference in any of the studied parameters compared to SN group. ... HCV positive patients are more prone to develop AC that is more extensive. HBV positive patients were less likely to have arterial medial calcification, probably related to lower serum phosphorus, CaxP product and PTH. HCV infection should be added as risk factor for AC among CKD patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.</snippet>

      <snippet>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) increases phosphorus excretion and decreases calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) levels. FGF23 increases from early stages of renal failure. We evaluated whether strict control of phosphorus intake in renal failure prevents the increase in FGF23 and to what extent inflammation impairs regulation of FGF23. The study was performed in 5/6 nephrectomized (Nx) Wistar rats fed diets containing 0.2-1.2% phosphorus for 3 or 15 days. FGF23 levels significantly increased in all Nx groups in the short-term (3-day) experiment. However, at 15 days, FGF23 increased in all Nx rats except in those fed 0.2% phosphorus. In a second experiment, Nx rats fed low phosphorus diets (0.2 and 0.4%) for 15 days received daily intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections to induce inflammation. In these rats, FGF23 increased despite the low phosphorus diets. Thus, higher FGF23 levels were needed to maintain phosphaturia and normal serum phosphorus values. Renal Klotho expression was preserved in Nx rats on a 0.2% phosphorus diet, reduced on a 0.4% phosphorus diet, and markedly reduced in Nx rats receiving LPS. In ex vivo experiments, high phosphorus and LPS increased nuclear β-catenin and p65-NFκB and decreased Klotho. Inhibition of inflammation and Wnt signaling activation resulted in decreased FGF23 levels and increased renal Klotho. In conclusion, strict control of phosphorus intake prevented the increase in FGF23 in renal failure, whereas inflammation independently increased FGF23 values. Decreased Klotho may explain the renal resistance to FGF23 in inflammation. These effects are likely mediated by the activation of NFkB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</snippet>

      <snippet>Complications of chronic kidney disease-associated mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are frequently observed in pediatric kidney transplant recipients and are associated with high morbidity, including growth failure, leg deformities, bone pain, fractures, osteonecrosis, and vascular calcification. Post-transplant CKD-MBD is mainly due to preexisting renal osteodystrophy and cardiovascular changes at the time of transplantation, glucocorticoid treatment, and reduced graft function. In addition, persistent elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 may cause hypophosphatemia, resulting in impaired bone mineralization. Patient monitoring should include assessment of growth, leg deformities, and serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH. Therapy should primarily focus on regular physical activity, preservation of transplant function, and steroid-sparing immunosuppressive protocols. In addition, adequate monitoring and treatment of vitamin D and mineral metabolism including vitamin D supplementation, oral phosphate, and/or magnesium supplementation, in case of persistent hypophosphatemia/hypomagnesemia, and treatment with active vitamin D in cases of persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism. The latter should be done using the minimum PTH-suppressive dosages aiming at the recommended CKD stage-dependent PTH target range. Finally, treatment with recombinant human growth hormone should be considered in patients lacking catch-up growth within the first year after transplantation.</snippet>

      <snippet>This review discusses the complications of nutrition, growth, neurocognitive function and mineral and bone disorder in pediatric chronic kidney disease. We discuss the most recent evidence-based methods for evaluation and prevention of these complications in addition to treatment strategies to address the complications and mitigate adverse effects. ... Frequent nutritional assessment is important, particularly for infants and young children. Due to anorexia, oral aversion and dietary restrictions, weight gain may be difficult to achieve. Adequate nutrition is important for growth. Children with CKD tend to be short, which can impact quality of life and social achievements. Once nutrition is optimized, growth hormone is an effective, but underutilized strategy to improving terminal height. Mineral and bone disorder is a difficult but common complication of CKD which may present with and be driven by abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels. Treatment strategies include dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphorus binders, and inactive vitamin D and active vitamin D sterols. Effective treatment may reduce the risk for bone deformities, growth abnormalities, fractures, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Children with CKD also suffer from cognitive difficulties. Control of anemia, aggressive childhood nutrition, and decreased exposure to heavy metals (via dialysate and dietary binding agents) has provided substantial improvement to the more profound neurocognitive sequelae observed prior to the 1990s. Current prevention of cognitive sequelae may best be directed at improved blood pressure control and augmented school support. ... Pediatric CKD has systemic ramifications and can impact all aspects of normal development, including nutrition, growth, bone and mineral metabolism and neurocognitive function. Regular evaluation for disease complications and prompt treatment can reduce the untoward effects of CKD thereby improving the quality and duration of life.</snippet>

      <snippet> In a high percentage of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) low levels of vitamin D are detected. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the native vitamin D therapy (cholecalciferol) in the patients with stage 3 and hypovitaminosis D allows to modify markers of bone and mineral metabolism once normal serum levels have been achieved. ... From an initial base of 297 patients with CKD and hypovitaminosis D, those with normal or high levels of PTH were chosen for therapy with native vitamin D. The initial administered dose was 1000 IU/day, with adjustments every 4 months of 1000 IU (maximum 4000 IU/day, according to RDA and IOM), until achieving serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL and lower than 80 ng/mL. The variables calcium, phosphorus, intact parathormone (iPTH), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were also evaluated every 4 months. ... The total number of patients included in this study was 170. Seventy-three patients were excluded along the follow-up: 17 non-responders (never achieved the projected serum levels of vitamin D), and 56 for not completing one year of follow-up. A total of 97 patients were finally included. In 82 patients, follow-up was achieved for 12 months (G1) and in 38 patients for 24 months (G2). In 15 patients despite achieving satisfactory levels of vitamin D at 12 months, it was not possible to obtain adequate levels of iPTH for their GFR according to K/DOQI 2003 guidelines and they were called refractory to therapy (G3). In both groups 1 and 2, a non-significant tendency to increase calcium and serum phosphorus was observed. iPTH decreased significantly at 12 and 24 months follow-up. In group 3, we opted at 12 months for conversion to calcitriol, with a significant reduction in iPTH values. In this group, the initial value of GFR was close to 30 mL/min, and its fall in time more significant than the other two groups to CKD stage 4. ... Cholecalciferol with adjustment in its dose, and obtaining normal serum levels is an excellent therapeutic alternative for the treatment of patients with CKD stage 3, and hypovitaminosis D. In the group of patients with GFR close to 30 mL/min, or lower values (stage 4), and with the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, the use of active form of vitamin D (calcitriol, paricalcitol) is recommended as the first therapeutic alternative.</snippet>

      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is part of the complex of chronic kidney disease-associated mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) and is linked with high bone turnover, ectopic calcification, and increased cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, measures for CKD-MBD aim at lowering PTH levels, but there is no general consensus on optimal PTH target values. This manuscript is part of a pros and cons debate for keeping PTH levels within the normal range in children with CKD, focusing on the cons. We conclude that a modest increase in PTH most likely represents an appropriate adaptive response to declining kidney function in patients with CKD stages 2-5D, due to phosphaturic effects and increasing bone resistance. There is no evidence for strictly keeping PTH levels within the normal range in CKD patients with respect to bone health and cardiovascular outcome. In addition, the potentially adverse effects of PTH-lowering measures, such as active vitamin D and calcimimetics, must be taken into account. We suggest that PTH values of 1-2 times the upper normal limit (ULN) may be acceptable in children with CKD stage 2-3, and that PTH levels of 1.7-5 times UNL may be optimal in patients with CKD stage 4-5D. However, standard care of CKD-MBD in children relies on a combination of different measures in which the observation of PTH levels is only a small part of, and trends in PTH levels rather than absolute target values should determine treatment decisions in patients with CKD as recommended by the 2017 KDIGO guidelines.</snippet>

      <snippet>Endothelial dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency are prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both are risk factors for cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. No studies have investigated the effect of nutritional forms of vitamin D on endothelial function in earlier stages of CKD, when vascular endothelium may be more amenable to this therapy. We studied the effect of ergocalciferol in a pre-clinical model of mild uraemia. Male Wistar rats underwent either a 5/6th nephrectomy or sham surgery. Four weeks after the final stage of the surgery, these two groups were randomly allocated to placebo or an oral dose of 1000 iu of ergocalcfierol at day 7 and 2 pre sacrifice. Vascular responses to acetylcholine, Spermine NONOate and phenylephrine were determined in aortic rings. Blood pressure, calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone were measured in all groups. Ergocalciferol significantly improved the endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine and overcame the blunting of the contractile response to phenylephrine seen in uraemic animals. Ergocalciferol improved the contractile response to potassium chloride in uraemic, but not sham animals. All effects occurred independently of changes to calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone and systolic blood pressure. There were no differences in endothelium-independent relaxation to Spermine NONOate. In summary, in a model of mild uraemia, ergocalciferol improved vasodilator and vasoconstrictor tone independently of blood pressure and bone mineral parameters suggesting a direct effect of ergocalciferol on the endothelium.</snippet>

CIMT was measured by ultrasonography. Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly higher (P = 0.046) in advanced CKD patients. CIMT was thicker in patients with advanced CKD patients (P = 0.01). CIMT was correlated with age (r = 0.486, P &lt;0.001), smoking (r = 0.411, P &lt;0.001), and 25-OH Vitamin D (r = -0.195, P= 0.045). There was no correlation between serum FGF23 and CIMT. Multivariate analysis showed that age (β = 0.373, P &lt;0.001), smoking (β = 0.228, P = 0.004), and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (β = -0.164, P = 0.042) were associated with CIMT. There was no relationship between FGF23 and CIMT. The CIMT was found to be related to increased age, smoking, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in CKD patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>The control of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in pediatric chronic kidney disease is of utmost importance. Even though parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important biomarker of mineral and bone disorders associated to CKD (CKD-MBD), calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D are also crucial and should be assessed together. In pediatric dialysis, high PTH levels have been associated with impaired longitudinal growth, bone disease, cardiovascular comorbidities, left ventricular hypertrophy, anemia, and even mortality (when PTH levels were above 500 pg/mL, i.e., 8.3-fold the upper normal limit (UNL)). As such, high PTH levels are for sure deleterious, but too low PTH levels have also been shown to impair growth and to promote vascular calcifications because of the underlying adynamic bone. This manuscript is part of a pros and cons debate for keeping PTH levels within the normal range in pediatric CKD, focusing on the pros. High bone turnover lesions can occur at lower PTH levels than &quot;current&quot; guidelines would suggest; thus, PTH alone is not a good predictor of the underlying osteodystrophy. PTH results can vary locally depending on the assay. Existing guidelines for PTH targets are conflicting and based on a very little evidence. However, the 120-180 pg/mL (2- to 3-fold the UNL) range is common to most of the guidelines; it seems to be a reasonable target in children undergoing dialysis, even though it does not correspond to &quot;normal&quot; PTH levels. As always, the philosophy of PTH levels in pediatric dialysis may be balanced, i.e., &quot;not too low, not too high, and keep phosphate under control.&quot;</snippet>

      <snippet>: Currently available treatment options for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in ND-CKD have limitations: the effectiveness of nutritional vitamin D supplements for reduction of PTH levels is unproven and active (1α-hydroxylated) vitamin D analogues elevate serum calcium, which increases the risk of hypercalcemia and vascular calcification. Clinical studies show that ERC is an effective, well tolerated treatment for SHPT in ND-CKD. ERC gradually raises serum 25D levels, resulting in physiologically regulated increases in serum 1,25D and sustained reductions in PTH, while avoiding clinically meaningful increases in serum phosphorus, calcium and fibroblast growth factor 23. ERC offers a new, effective and well tolerated treatment option for the early management of SHPT in patients with ND-CKD.</snippet>

Complications of mineral bone disease (MBD) are common and contribute to the high morbidity and mortality seen in children with CKD. Although several studies describe the prevalence of abnormal calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D levels as well as associated clinical and radiological complications and their medical management, little is known about the dietary requirements and management of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) in children with CKD.

We present CPRs for the dietary intake of Ca and P in children with CKD stages 2-5 and on dialysis (CKD2-5D), describing the common Ca- and P-containing foods, the assessment of dietary Ca and P intake, requirements for Ca and P in healthy children and necessary modifications for children with CKD2-5D, and dietary management of hypo- and hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The statements have been graded, and statements with a low grade or those that are opinion-based must be carefully considered and adapted to individual patient needs based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician and dietitian.

      <snippet>Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of fractures in a cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with possible risk factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 patients, since they started HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters as well as vascular calcifications (VC) were evaluated. Fifty-seven episodes of fracture were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months (incidence rate of 31 per 1000 person-years). Age (p &lt; 0.001), female gender (p &lt; 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.02), and higher VC score (p &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p = 0.03) was associated with decreased risk. A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) (p = 0.01) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either &lt; 300 pg/mL (p = 0.02) or &gt; 800 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. In conclusion, bone fracture incidence in HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, lower serum albumin, and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high iPTH levels or increased bALP also had a higher fracture risk. Therapy with active vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.</snippet>

      <snippet>The prevalence of suboptimal Vitamin D levels is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in the general population. Recent findings suggest that progression of CKD is linked to a suboptimal Vitamin D level. A high percentage of CKD patients have severe Vitamin D deficiency. These patients also have a low level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] and consequently, a reduced ability to form active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Various factors underlie the low level of 25(OH)D, including a sedentary lifestyle, decreased intake of Vitamin D due to CKD-related dietary restrictions, and decreased synthesis of Vitamin D in skin due to uremia. All these factors may be particularly influential in patients with progressively worsening CKD, including those receiving chronic dialysis. The objective of our study is to determine the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in children with CKD stages three to five and those receiving chronic dialysis, to ascertain whether there is a relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and the stage of CKD, and to identify any clinical correlates associated with the Vitamin D status. A single-center, retrospective review was conducted of 46 children (younger than 18 years) with CKD stages 3-5D who attended the renal clinic of the Red Cross Children&apos;s Hospital between October 2013 and November 2014. In total, 73.9% of the study population had suboptimal Vitamin D levels (43.5% and 30.4% had Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, respectively). The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in older children (≥10 years of age) than in younger children (P = 0.000) but did not significantly differ between males and females (P = 0.693). In total, 12 of 15 black children (80%), 19 of 26 colored children (73.1%), two of four white children (50%), and one Asian child (100%) had suboptimal Vitamin D levels. Neither white nor Asian child had Vitamin D deficiency. In addition, 90% of patients undergoing chronic dialysis, 80% of whom were receiving peritoneal dialysis, had suboptimal Vitamin D levels. Age, weight, height, and the albumin concentration were significantly associated with the Vitamin D level. There was a positive linear relationship between the Vitamin D level and the serum albumin concentration (Spearman&apos;s rho correlation coefficient = 0.397, P = 0.007). In total, 87.5% of patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria had suboptimal Vitamin D levels, and 80% were Vitamin D deficient (P = 0.004). A higher percentage of Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency cases was documented during the winter (24/34, 70.6%) than during the summer (10/34, 29.4%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.685). Sub-optimal Vitamin D is high among children with moderate to severe CKD and significantly higher in those undergoing chronic dialysis. The emerging evidence of the role of Vitamin D in slowing progression of CKD highlights the need for monitoring and correction of Vitamin D levels in predialysis children.</snippet>

      <snippet>In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), adverse outcomes such as systemic inflammation and anemia are contributing pathologies which increase the risks for cardiovascular mortality. Amongst these complications, abnormalities in mineral metabolism and the metabolic milieu are associated with chronic inflammation and iron dysregulation, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a risk factor in this context. FGF23 is a bone-derived hormone that is essential for regulating vitamin D and phosphate homeostasis. In the early stages of CKD, serum FGF23 levels rise 1000-fold above normal values in an attempt to maintain normal phosphate levels. Despite this compensatory action, clinical CKD studies have demonstrated powerful and dose-dependent associations between FGF23 levels and higher risks for mortality. A prospective pathomechanism coupling elevated serum FGF23 levels with CKD-associated anemia and cardiovascular injury is its strong association with chronic inflammation. In this review, we will examine the current experimental and clinical evidence regarding the role of FGF23 in renal physiology as well as in the pathophysiology of CKD with an emphasis on chronic inflammation and anemia.</snippet>

      <snippet>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of premature mortality, mainly from cardiovascular causes. The association between CKD on hemodialysis and accelerated atherosclerosis was described &gt;40 years ago. However, more recently, it has been suggested that the increase in atherosclerosis risk is actually observed in early CKD stages, remaining stable thereafter. In this regard, interventions targeting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as statins, successful in the general population, have failed to benefit patients with very advanced CKD. This raises the issue of the relative contribution of atherosclerosis versus other forms of cardiovascular injury such as arteriosclerosis or myocardial injury to the increased cardiovascular risk in CKD. In this review, the pathophysiogical contributors to atherosclerosis in CKD that are shared with the general population, or specific to CKD, are discussed. The NEFRONA study (Observatorio Nacional de Atherosclerosis en NEFrologia) prospectively assessed the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque in vascular ultrasound), confirming an increased prevalence of atherosclerosis in patients with moderate CKD. However, the adjusted odds ratio for subclinical atherosclerosis increased with CKD stage, suggesting a contribution of CKD itself to subclinical atherosclerosis. Progression of atherosclerosis was closely related to CKD progression as well as to the baseline presence of atheroma plaque, and to higher phosphate, uric acid, and ferritin and lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels. These insights may help design future clinical trials of stratified personalized medicine targeting atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. Future primary prevention trials should enroll patients with evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and should provide a comprehensive control of all known risk factors in addition to testing any additional intervention or placebo.</snippet>

So, we aimed to determine the prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and abnormal renal parameters, with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus pateints MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at private health care centre. A total of 300 diabetic patients aged 18 years and above attended the clinic from February 2018 to Dec 2018 were included. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records of patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using (SPSS, version 23).</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease is associated with accumulation of uremic toxins that increases insulin resistance which will lead to blunted ability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and reduce peripheral utilization of insulin. CKD patients fail to increase insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance because of acidosis, 1,25 vitamin D deficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hemodialysis causes further fluctuations in glycemic control due to alterations in insulin secretion, clearance and resistance. DKA is uncommon in hemodialysis patients because of the absence of glycosuria and osmotic diuresis which accounts for most of the fluid and electrolyte losses seen in DKA, anuric patients may be somewhat protected from dehydration and shock, although still subject to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. However, substantial volume loss can still occur due to a prolonged decrease in oral intake or increased insensible water losses related to tachypnoea and fever. There is no current guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in anuric hemodialysis patients considering their differences than general population. In this review article we reviewed the literature and came with specific recommendations for management of Ketoacidosis in patients with CKD treated by hemodialysis.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with CKD and is associated with vascular dysfunction and inflammation. In recent years, some randomized controlled trials have revealed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on vascular function and inflammation in CKD patients, but the results are inconsistent. Thus, in light of the controversy, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of vitamin D in patients with CKD. We searched the literature in multiple databases for clinical trials from the date of inception to December 2018. The standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size was pooled using fixed and random effects models. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 579 patients were included in the meta-analysis; among these, 313 patients were treated with vitamin D, and the control group included 266 who received a placebo. This meta-analysis revealed no statistical significance in the levels of flow-mediated dilatation (SMD, 0.94; 95% CI, -0.33 to 2.21; P = 0.15); pulse wave velocity (SMD, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.13; P = 0.33); systolic BP (SMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.22; P = 0.77); diastolic BP (SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.27; P = 0.97); and CRP (SMD, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.44 to 0.26; P = 0.61) between the vitamin D group and controls for patients with CKD. Short-term intervention with vitamin D was not associated with improvements in vascular function and inflammation, as measured by flow-mediated dilatation, pulse wave velocity, systolic BP, diastolic BP and CRP. This suggested that there is insufficient evidence to conclude the benefit of vitamin D supplementation on vascular function and inflammation in CKD patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a pathological condition associated with renal osteodystrophy for which there are limited treatment options. Gut-derived serotonin (GDS) is one of the key signaling factors controlling the osteoblast proliferation. Previously, we shown that inhibition of GDS synthesis by LP533401 improved bone mineral status of rats with 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD model. Here, we investigated whether the use of LP533401 can modify GDS-dependent molecular pathway involved in osteoblast formation and bone mineralization in CKD rats. The 8-weeks of pharmacological manipulation after a complete CKD development reduced GDS and lead to the advantage of endogenous vitamin D [25(OH)D] over serotonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in rats treated with LP533401. The imbalance between GDS - 25(OH)D - PTH resulted in the intensified expression of cAMP- responsive element-binding protein (Creb), whereas the expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc) was simultaneously reduced. This lead to disruption of Foxo1- activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) complex, and decrease in the expression of the major osteogenic markers. The weakening of excessive osteoblastogenesis was associated with better bone mineral status in all rats with CKD, and especially in LP533401-treated animals. In conclusion, the inhibition of GDS synthesis resulted in the mitigation of osteoblastogenesis observed in CKD, which translated into improvement of bone mineral status. This study provides key mechanistic insights into how modification of GDS-dependent molecular pathway affects bone mineral status in CKD and lays the groundwork for translating the role of functional serotonin signaling in the origin of impaired bone mineral status in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Traditional Chinese medicine provides a unique curative treatment of complex chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not effectively treated with the current therapies. The pharmacological mechanisms of Shenkang (SK), a herbal medicine containing rhubarb (Rheum palmatum L. or R. tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf.), red sage (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), and astragalus (Astragalus mongholicus Bunge), widely used to treat CKD in China, are still unclear. ... In this study, the comprehensive approach used for elucidating the pharmacological mechanisms of SK included the identification of the effective constituents, target prediction and network analysis, by investigating the interacting pathways between these molecules in the context of CKD. These results were validated by performing an in vivo study and by comparison with literature reviews.</snippet>

      <snippet>vitamin D also increased the ratio of RANKL/OPG expression in CKD osteoblasts. Vitamin D sterols directly stimulate osteoblast maturation. They also increase osteocyte turnover and increase osteoblast expression of osteoclast differentiation factors, thus likely modulating osteoblast/osteoclast/osteocyte coupling. By increasing numbers of early osteocytes, vitamin D sterols increase FGF23 expression in CKD bone.</snippet>

      <snippet>Microparticles (MPs) are biomarkers and mediators of disease through their expression of surface receptors, reflecting activation or stress in their parent cells. Endothelial markers, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, are implicated in atherosclerosis and associated with cardiovascular risk. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have endothelial dysfunction and high levels of endothelial derived MPs. Vitamin D treatment has been reported to ameliorate endothelial function in CKD patients. We aimed to examine cell specific MP profiles and concentrations of MPs expressing the atherosclerotic markers ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 after treatment with paricalcitol in patients with CKD stage 3-4. ... Sub-study of the previously reported SOLID trial where 36 patients were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 or 2 μg paricalcitol, for 12 weeks. MPs were measured by flow cytometry after labelling with antibodies against endothelial (CD62E), platelet (CD62P, CD41, CD154) leukocyte (CD45) and vascular (CD54, CD106) markers. ... . Concentrations of ICAM-1 positive MPs were significantly reduced by treatment (repeated measures ANOVA p = 0.04). Repeated measures MANOVA of concentrations of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte MPs showed sustained levels in the 2 μg treatment group (p = 0.85) but a decline in the 1 μg (p = 0.04) and placebo groups (p = 0.005). ... Treatment with paricalcitol reduces concentrations of ICAM-1 positive MPs. This is accompanied by sustained concentrations of all cell specific MPs in the 2 μg group, and decreasing concentrations in the other groups, possibly due to a more healthy and reactive endothelium with paricalcitol treatment.</snippet>

      <snippet>The recent observation that urinary calcium excretion (UCE) drops considerably with CKD and that this effect may occur beyond compensation for reduced intestinal calcium absorption suggests that CKD per se is a state of sustained positive calcium balance, a mechanism likely to contribute to vascular calcification and CVD in CKD. However, the determinants of UCE reduction in CKD are not well understood and there is a lack of clinical studies, particularly in the CKD population. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate variables associated with UCE in a CKD cohort.</snippet>

      <snippet>Insight in the prescribing quality for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in secondary care is limited. The aim of this study is to assess the prescribing quality in secondary care patients with CKD stages 3-5 and possible differences in quality between CKD stages. ... This was a retrospective cohort study. ... Data were collected at two university (n=569 and n=845) and one non-university nephrology outpatient clinic (n=1718) in the Netherlands. ... Between March 2015 and August 2016, data were collected from patients with stages 3a-5 CKD seen at the clinics. Blood pressure measurements, laboratory measurements and prescription data were extracted from medical records. For each prescribing quality indicator, patients with incomplete data required for calculation were excluded. ...  or Fisher&apos;s exact tests were used to test for differences in prescribing quality. ... RAAS inhibitors alone or in combination with diuretics (57% or 52%, respectively) and statins (42%) were prescribed less often than phosphate binders (72%) or antihypertensives (94%) when indicated. Active vitamin D was relatively often prescribed when potentially not indicated (19%). Patients with high CKD stages were less likely to receive RAAS inhibitors but more likely to receive statins when indicated than stage 3 CKD patients. They also received more active vitamin D and erythropoietin-stimulating agents when potentially not indicated. ... Priority areas for improvement of prescribing in CKD outpatients include potential underprescribing of RAAS inhibitors and statins, and potential overprescribing of active vitamin D. CKD stage should be taken into account when assessing prescribing quality.</snippet>
