      <snippet>Individuals with diabetes have remarkably high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the incremental cardiovascular risk in diabetes is heterogeneous and has often been related to renal involvement. The purpose of this study was to analyse the prognostic value of subclinical atherosclerosis in determining the incidence of first cardiovascular events (CVEs) in individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to CKD individuals without diabetes. ... We included data from individuals with CKD with and without diabetes, free from pre-existing cardiovascular disease, from the NEFRONA cohort. Participants underwent baseline carotid and femoral ultrasound and were followed up for 4 years. All CVEs during follow-up were registered. Bivariate analysis and Fine-Gray competing risk models were used to perform the statistical analysis. ... During the mean follow-up time of 48 months, a total of 203 CVE was registered. 107 CVE occurred among participants without diabetes (19.58 per 1000 person-years) and 96 CVE occurred among participants with diabetes (44.44 per 1000 person-years). Following the competing risk analysis, the variables predicting CVEs in CKD individuals without diabetes were the number of territories with plaque at baseline (HR 1.862, 95% CI [1.432;2.240]), age (HR 1.026, 95% CI [1.003;1.049]) and serum concentrations of 25-OH vitamin D (HR 0.963, 95% CI [0.933;0.094]). The only variable predicting CVEs among CKD participants with diabetes was the number of territories with plaque at baseline (HR 1.782, 95% CI [1.393, 2.278]). For both models, concordance (C) index yielded was over 0.7. ... The burden of subclinical atherosclerosis is the strongest predictor of future CVEs in diabetic individuals with CKD. Early detection of subclinical atherosclerotic burden by multiterritorial vascular ultrasound could improve CVE prediction in this population.</snippet>

      <snippet>CKD has been recognized as risk factors for 25(OH) D deficiency, and Low levels of 25(OH) D have been suggested to be a trigger factor of decreased level of Hb. However, there is lack of information about the magnitude of 25(OH) D deficiency and Hb level in Nepalese CKD patients. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D in non-dialyzed CKD patients, and further to examine its association with Hb level. ... In this cross-sectional study, we examined 172 clinically stable patients with an eGFR at CKD stage2-5 not on dialysis. Serum 25(OH) D, Hb, levels were evaluated as a core variables and the other variables such as age, sex, co-morbidities (HTN, DM), eGFR, Hb, iPTH, serum phosphate, albumin, calcium, and phosphate level were evaluated as a covariates. Serum 25(OH) D, Hb levels and the factors associated with 25(OH) D level were evaluated. ... The estimated prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D metabolite (&lt; 30 ng/mL) in this predialysis patients were (87.8%), with 32 and 55.8% deficiency and insufficiency 25(OH) D metabolite, respectively. On regression analysis, serum 25(OH) D was positively associated with male subjects (P = 0.02), serum albumin(P = 0.002), and eGFR (P = 0.042), while inversely associated with age (P = 0.006), iPTH(P = 0.025). Hb concentration was found to be positively correlated with 25(OH) D (P &lt; 0.05) in both univariate as well as in multivariate analysis. ... A high prevalence of abnormal 25(OH) D metabolite was observed in early CKD patients. Our study shows that lower level of 25(OH) D level are associated with lower level of Hb and higher level of iPTH, and could play a role in the development of anemia and hyperparathyroidism.</snippet>

      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a major complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), responsible for skeletal and vascular damage with increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular events, and mortality. However, the optimal serum parathormone (PTH) levels for improving clinical outcomes remain uncertain. Treatment of SHPT is based on nutritional therapy, phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics, but none of these interventions has ever been tested against placebo in randomized controlled trials. Treatment of SHPT in the elderly should consider the many peculiarities of aging in terms of physiopathology, quality of life, symptoms, subjective perception of disease, drug load, and the modifying effect of treatment on disease-related outcomes. Unfortunately, peculiarities of SHPT among elderly CKD patients are mainly unexplored. The present review aims to provide a reasonable merging of evidence regarding the management of SHPT in CKD, with more actual concepts on how to care for older patients.</snippet>

This secondary analysis aimed to determine if changes in associated therapies may have influenced these findings and to identify differences between patient subgroups. ... The ACTIVE Dialysis study randomised 200 participants to extended hours haemodialysis (≥24 h/week) or conventional haemodialysis (≤18 h/week) for 12 months. Mean differences between treatment arms in serum phosphate, calcium and PTH; and among key subgroups (high vs. low baseline phosphate/PTH, region, time on dialysis, dialysis setting and frequency) were examined using mixed linear regression. ... Phosphate binder use was reduced with extended hours (- 0.83 tablets per day [95% CI -1.61, - 0.04; p = 0.04]), but no differences in type of phosphate binder, use of vitamin D, dose of cinacalcet or dialysate calcium were observed.

After adenine treatment, mice displayed increased blood urea nitrogen, decreased serum 1,25(OH)2D, and severe hyperparathyroidism. Skeletal expression of Cyp27b1 and of sclerostin and serum sclerostin all increased in WT mice but not in Oct-1α(OH)ase-/- mice or global-1α(OH)ase-/- mice. In contrast, skeletal expression of BMP2 and serum BMP2 rose in the Oct-1α(OH)ase-/- mice and in the global-1α(OH)ase-/- mice. Extraskeletal calcification occurred in muscle and blood vessels of mice with CKD and was highest in Oct-1α(OH)ase-/-mice. In vitro, recombinant sclerostin (100 ng/mL) significantly suppressed BMP2-induced osteoblastic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle A7r5 cells and diminished BMP2-induced mineralization. Our study provides evidence that local osteocytic production of 1,25(OH)2D stimulates sclerostin and inhibits BMP2 production in murine CKD, thus mitigating osteoblastic transdifferentiation and mineralization of soft tissues. Increased osteocytic 1,25(OH)2D production, triggered by renal malfunction, may represent a &quot;primary defensive response&quot; to protect the organism from ectopic calcification by increasing sclerostin and suppressing BMP2 production.</snippet>

      <snippet>BACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline. Cardiovascular and dialysis-related factors might also be involved in the mechanism of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors including intracranial artery calcification and dialysis-related factors such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) might be associated with cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study included patients receiving in-center hemodialysis over 6 months at our hospital. All patients underwent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) examinations. Internal carotid artery (ICA) calcium scores were measured using the Agatston method. The Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used for measurement of cognitive function at each study visit. Serum concentrations of FGF23, osteoprotegerin, and klotho were analyzed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS This study included 69 patients. Cognitive impairment was observed in 22 patients (31.9%), including 3 patients with dementia. ICA calcium score in patients with cognitive impairment was higher than that in those without cognitive impairment (177.3 versus 87.6, P=0.022). Intracranial artery calcification was significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting for FGF23 and 25-OH vitamin D, but not significant after adjusting for age, FGF23, and 25-OH vitamin D. Low level of FGF23 was associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial artery calcification and low FGF23 could be associated with cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether intracranial artery calcification and FGF23 could affect cognitive function of hemodialysis patients.</snippet>

The study outcomes were left ventricular mass z-score (LVMZ) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). The potential risk factors considered were age, gender, CKD etiology, use of oral vitamin D and calcium-based phosphate binders, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index z-score, time since diagnosis, dialysis duration, serum levels of ionic calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor (FGF 23), uric acid, homocysteine, cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), vitamin D and hemoglobin. ... In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with LVMZ were dialysis duration, age, systolic blood pressure, serum hemoglobin and HDL cholesterol levels. Regarding CIMT, in the multivariate analysis, systolic blood pressure was the only factor associated with the outcome. ... Children exhibited important cardiovascular involvement at the time of the renal transplantation. Both of the studied outcomes were independently associated with systolic blood pressure.

      <snippet>Mineral and bone disorder in chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) is a triad of biochemical imbalances of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D, bone abnormalities and soft tissue calcification. Maintaining optimal bone health in children with CKD is important to prevent long-term complications, such as fractures, to optimise growth and possibly also to prevent extra-osseous calcification, especially vascular calcification. In this review, we discuss normal bone mineralisation, the pathophysiology of dysregulated homeostasis leading to mineralisation defects in CKD and its clinical consequences. Bone mineralisation is best assessed on bone histology and histomorphometry, but given the rarity with which this is performed, we present an overview of the tools available to clinicians to assess bone mineral density, including serum biomarkers and imaging such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. We discuss key studies that have used these techniques, their advantages and disadvantages in childhood CKD and their relationship to biomarkers and bone histomorphometry. Finally, we present recommendations from relevant guidelines-Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes and the International Society of Clinical Densitometry-on the use of imaging, biomarkers and bone biopsy in assessing bone mineral density. Given low-level evidence from most paediatric studies, bone imaging and histology remain largely research tools, and current clinical management is guided by serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase levels only.</snippet>

      <snippet>The goal of study was to find factors associated with vitamin D levels in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and early stages of kidney dysfunction. The study included 338 patients with 1-2 COPD stages (66,9% of men, mean age was 69,4±6,1 years, mean COPD duration was 18,5±4,1 years); 33,1% of women (mean age 64,8±7,3 years, mean COPD duration was 12,1±5,1 years). All patients were diagnosed with 1-2 stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to general clinical examination, potential risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were assessed. During multiple regression with step-by-step inclusion method the following factors showed a significant contribution to the formation of vitamin D levels in patients with COPD and early stages of renal dysfunction: the frequency of exacerbations of COPD in the preceding 12 months (3 (2-4), β=0,932, p=0,003), SI (44 (15-87), β=0,038, p=0,006), fibrinogen level (5 (3-7), β=0,413, p=0,016), GFR (74,9 (68,4-89), β=0,119, p=0,041), insolation (94,5 (38,5-152), β=0,026, p=0,0008),the total score on a GDS scale (9 (8-11), β=0,536, p=0,014). R2 for this model was 0,87. BMI made a significant contribution to the formation of vitamin D level at the step of inclusion to the multivariate analysis, but when included in the analysis of insolation markers, the relationship weakened and completely disappeared when the values of SI were included. FEV1 values do not affect on vitamin D level in COPD patients in combination with early stages of kidney dysfunction.</snippet>

      <snippet>Diabetes mellitus (DM) poses a major public health problem worldwide, with ever-increasing incidence and prevalence in recent years. The Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) expects that the total number of people with type 1 and type 2 DM in the United States will increase by 54%, from 19,629,000 to 54,913,000 people, between 2015 and 2030. Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) affects about one-third of patients with DM and currently ranks as the first cause of end-stage kidney disease in the Western world. The complexity of interactions of Vitamin D is directly related with progressive long-term changes implicated in the worsening of renal function. These changes result in a dysregulation of the vitamin D-dependent pathways. Various studies demonstrated a pivotal role of Vitamin D supplementation in regression of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis, contrasting the increase of glomerular basement membrane thickening and podocyte effacement, with better renal and cardiovascular outcomes. The homeostasis and regulation of the nephron&apos;s function are absolutely dependent from the cross-talk between endothelium and podocytes. Even if growing evidence proves that vitamin D may have antiproteinuric, anti-inflammatory and renoprotective effects in patients with DN, it is still worth investigating these aspects with both more in vitro studies and randomized controlled trials in larger patient series and with adequate follow-up to confirm the effects of long-term vitamin D analogue supplementation in DN and to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy and the appropriate dosage.</snippet>

      <snippet>Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive storage disease due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes. Since the accumulation of intracellular cystine affects all organs and tissues, the management of cystinosis requires a specialized multidisciplinary team consisting of pediatricians, nephrologists, nutritionists, ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, neurologists&apos; geneticists, and orthopedic surgeons. Treatment with cysteamine can delay or prevent most clinical manifestations of cystinosis, except the renal Fanconi syndrome. Virtually all individuals with classical, nephropathic cystinosis suffer from cystinosis metabolic bone disease (CMBD), related to the renal Fanconi syndrome in infancy and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) later in life. Manifestations of CMBD include hypophosphatemic rickets in infancy, and renal osteodystrophy associated with CKD resulting in bone deformities, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, fractures, and short stature. Assessment of CMBD involves monitoring growth, leg deformities, blood levels of phosphate, electrolytes, bicarbonate, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase, periodically obtaining bone radiographs, determining levels of critical hormones and vitamins, such as thyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone, 25(OH) vitamin D, and testosterone in males, and surveillance for nonrenal complications of cystinosis such as myopathy. Treatment includes replacement of urinary losses, cystine depletion with oral cysteamine, vitamin D, hormone replacement, physical therapy, and corrective orthopedic surgery. The recommendations in this article came from an expert meeting on CMBD that took place in Salzburg, Austria, in December 2016.</snippet>

One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults (98 male and 74 female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained arterial samples, all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D. ... Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal (subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), while 21 (12%) had both intimal and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six patients (50%) were devoid of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly higher serum level of PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose significant difference in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. On the other hand, there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, serum PTH, and FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification. ... Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly in tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification intensity.</snippet>

PubMed was searched for articles in English from 1960 to 2018 for advanced CKD and diabetes, glucose and insulin metabolism, insulin clearance, secretion and resistance, plasma insulin concentration, glycemic control, hypoglycemia, insulin dosage, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in CKD. ... The evidence shows that in most patients the daily dose of insulin needs to be significantly reduced with a high degree of variability; in some the dose remains unchanged, and rarely it is increased. The premise that the marked reduction in insulin requirement is essentially attributable to decreased insulin clearance by kidneys leading to prolongation of its plasma half-life, elevated blood insulin concentration, and hypoglycemia is not entirely correct. Other factors including decreases in food intake, insulin secretion, insulin clearance by peripheral tissues, and renal gluconeogenesis play important roles. There is also heightened resistance to insulin due to metabolic acidosis, uremic toxins, inflammatory state, and vitamin D deficiency. Importantly, the magnitude of changes in each of these factors varies between individuals with the same degree of CKD. ... In the presence of diabetes with advanced CKD, the insulin regimen should be individualized based on knowledge of the daily glucose patterns. The use of CGM is promising for safer glycemic control in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes and helps prevent extremes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.</snippet>

Efficacy of treatment of ED in the CKD population is comparable to non-CKD patients across multiple modalities, including PDE5 inhibitors, vacuum erectile devices, intracavernosal injections and penile prostheses. Renal transplant improves the contributing comorbid conditions that lead to ED in CKD patients; thus rates of ED are improved post-transplant.

      <snippet>Accumulating evidence indicates that the pathological changes of the endothelium may contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Non-traditional risk factors related to CKD are associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease, but their role in uraemic endothelial dysfunction has often been disregarded. In this context, soluble α-Klotho and vitamin D are of importance to maintain endothelial integrity, but their concentrations decline in CKD, thereby contributing to the dysfunction of the endothelial lining. These hormonal disturbances are accompanied by an increment of circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 and phosphate, both exacerbating endothelial toxicities. Furthermore, impaired renal function leads to an increment of inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species and uraemic toxins that further aggravate the endothelial abnormalities and in turn also inhibit the regeneration of disrupted endothelial lining. Here, we highlight the distinct endothelial alterations mediated by the abovementioned non-traditional risk factors as demonstrated in experimental studies and connect these to pathological changes in CKD patients, which are driven by endothelial disturbances, other than atherosclerosis. In addition, we describe therapeutic strategies that may promote restoration of endothelial abnormalities by modulating imbalanced mineral homoeostasis and attenuate the impact of uraemic retention molecules, inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species. A clinical perspective on endothelial dysfunction in CKD may translate into reduced structural and functional abnormalities of the vessel wall in CKD, and ultimately improved cardiovascular disease.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vascular calcification (VC) and malnutrition associated with cardiovascular disease are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated with dialysis. VC, which reflects vascular aging, and malnutrition are also encountered in the non-CKD elderly population. This similarity of clinical findings suggests that the progression of CKD is related to aging and the existence of a causal relationship between VC and malnutrition. To retard renal progression, a low- or very-low-protein diet is usually recommended for CKD patients. Dietary education may induce malnutrition and deficiency of important nutrients, such as vitamins K and D. Menaquinone-7, a type of vitamin K2, is under investigation for inhibiting VC in elderly patients without CKD, as well as for prevention of VC in patients with CKD. Nutritional vitamin D, such as cholecalciferol, may be considered to decrease the required dose of active vitamin D, which increases the risk of VC due to increased calcium and phosphate loads. Omega-3 fatty acids are important nutrients and their ability to inhibit VC needs to be evaluated in clinical trials. This review focuses on the ability of supplementary nutrients to prevent VC in patients with CKD, in whom dietary restriction is essential.</snippet>

The pathogenesis of VC is complex, resulting in increased arterial stiffening, which is associated with cardiovascular mortality. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients also have a number of non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of VC. ... Management of CKD-mineral bone disorder using conventional therapeutic approaches, which include restricting dietary phosphate, administering phosphate binders, and using active vitamin D and calcimimetics, may inhibit the progression of VC, but these approaches remain controversial because recommended biochemical targets are difficult to achieve. Current treatment strategies focus on correcting abnormal calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D levels in ESRD patients. Novel therapies for addressing VC include magnesium and vitamin K supplementation, which are currently being investigated in randomized controlled trials. This review summarizes current treatment strategies and therapeutic targets for the management of VC in patients with ESRD. Key Messages: A better understanding of the potential therapeutic approaches to VC may lead to improved mortality rates among patients with CKD including those on dialysis. Fetuin-A inhibits VC by binding to the nanoparticles of calcium and phosphate, preventing mineral accretion. These particles are known as calciprotein particles and may provide an important pathway for mineral transport and clearance.

      <snippet>Altered parathyroid gland biology in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major contributor to chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). This disorder is associated with an increased risk of bone disorders, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular events. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion is primarily regulated by the ionized calcium concentration as well as the phosphate concentration in the extracellular fluid and vitamin D. The metabolic disturbances in patients with CKD lead to alterations in the parathyroid gland biology. A hallmark of CKD is secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by an increased production and release of PTH, reduced expression of calcium-sensing and vitamin D receptors on the surface of parathyroid cells, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of these cells. These alterations happen on different timescales and influence each other, thereby triggering a cascade of negative and positive feedback loops in a highly complex manner. Due to this complexity, mathematical models are a useful tool to break down the patterns of the multidimensional cascade of processes enabling the detailed study of subsystems. Here, we introduce a comprehensive mathematical model that includes the major adaptive mechanisms governing the production, secretion, and degradation of PTH in patients with CKD on hemodialysis. Combined with models for medications targeting the parathyroid gland, it provides a ready-to-use tool to explore treatment strategies. While the model is of particular interest for use in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, it has the potential to be applicable to other clinical scenarios such as primary hyperparathyroidism or hypo- and hypercalcemia.</snippet>

      <snippet>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) plays a key role in the complex network between the bones and other organs. Initially, it was thought that FGF23 exclusively regulated phosphate and vitamin D metabolism; however, recent research has demonstrated that an excess of FGF23 has other effects that may be detrimental in some cases. The understanding of the signaling pathways through which FGF23 acts in different organs is crucial to develop strategies aiming to prevent the negative effects associated with high FGF23 levels. FGF23 has been described to have effects on the heart, promoting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); the liver, leading to production of inflammatory cytokines; the bones, inhibiting mineralization; and the bone marrow, by reducing the production of erythropoietin (EPO). The identification of FGF23 receptors will play a remarkable role in future research since its selective blockade might reduce the adverse effects of FGF23. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have very high levels of FGF23 and may be the population suffering from the most adverse FGF23-related effects. The general population, as well as kidney transplant recipients, may also be affected by high FGF23. Whether the association between FGF23 and clinical events is causal or casual remains controversial. The hypothesis that FGF23 could be considered a therapeutic target is gaining relevance and may become a promising field of investigation in the future.</snippet>

Adult subjects (n = 429) with SHPT, VDI, and stage 3 or 4 CKD were stratified by stage and treated daily with either extended-release calcifediol (ERC) or placebo in 2 identical, parallel, randomized, double-blind studies. After treatment for 26 weeks, all subjects were ranked by the level of serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D and divided into quintiles in order to examine the relationships between the degree of vitamin D repletion and the associated changes in plasma iPTH, serum bone turnover markers, calcium, phosphorus, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and vitamin D metabolites, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine calcium:creatinine (Ca:Cr) ratio. ... Progressive increases in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and reductions in plasma iPTH and serum bone turnover markers were observed as mean posttreatment serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D rose from 13.9 ng/mL (in Quintile 1) to 92.5 ng/mL (in Quintile 5), irrespective of CKD stage. Mean serum calcium, phosphorus and FGF23, eGFR, and urine Ca:Cr ratio (collectively &quot;safety parameters&quot;) did not significantly change from Quintile 1.

      <snippet>The use of immunosuppressive agents, especially glucocorticoids, are associated with increased risks of bone loss in kidney transplant patients. Denosumab, a potent antiresorptive agent, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with CKD. However, its effects on bone metabolism and BMD in kidney transplant patients remain unclear. ... A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database from inception through April 2018 to identify studies evaluating denosumab&apos;s effect on changes in bone metabolism and BMD from baseline to post-treatment course in kidney transplant patients. Study results were pooled and analyzed utilizing random-effects model. The protocol for this systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42018095055). ... . After treatment (≥ 6 to 12 months), there were significant increases in BMD with standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 3.26 (95% CI 0.88-5.64) and 1.83 (95% CI 0.43 to 3.22) for lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively. There were also significant increases in T scores with SMDs of 0.92 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.25) and 1.14 (95% CI 0.17 to 2.10) for lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively. After treatment, there were no significant changes in serum calcium (Ca) or parathyroid hormone (PTH) from baseline to post-treatment course (≥ 6 months) with mean differences (MDs) of 0.52 (95% CI, - 0.13 to 1.16) mmol/L and - 13.24 (95% CI, - 43.85 to 17.37) ng/L, respectively. The clinical trial data demonstrated more asymptomatic hypocalcemia in the denosumab (12 episodes in 39 patients) than in the control (1 episode in 42 patients) group. From the cohort studies, the pooled incidence of hypocalcemia following denosumab treatment was 1.7% (95% CI 0.4 to 6.6%). All reported hypocalcemic episodes were mild and asymptomatic, but the majority of patients required Ca and vitamin D supplements. ... Among kidney transplant patients with good allograft function, denosumab effectively increases BMD and T scores in the lumbar spine and femur neck. From baseline to post-treatment, there are no differences in serum Ca and PTH. However, mild hypocalcemia can occur following denosumab treatment, requiring monitoring and titration of Ca and vitamin D supplements.</snippet>

To determine guideline adherence, we used administrative claims records from the 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries with Parts A, B, and D coverage, 2007 to 2015, and identified cohorts of patients with nondialysis stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD. Testing for biochemical markers during follow-up was defined based on laboratory procedure codes. Baseline factors associated with laboratory testing were determined using logistic regression.

The frequency of testing was low for PTH (35.2-48.2%), phosphorus (46.6-62.0%), and 25D (29.3-46.7%). Testing was somewhat higher for calcium (88.1-95.4%) and ALP (63.5-88.1%); most tests were features of larger panels (e.g., basic metabolic panel).

      <snippet>Calcium supplements are broadly prescribed to treat osteoporosis either as monotherapy or together with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption. It is still unclear whether calcium supplementation significantly contributes to the reduction of bone fragility and fracture risk. Data suggest that supplementing post-menopausal women with high doses of calcium has a detrimental impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are prone to vascular calcification in part due to impaired phosphate excretion. Calcium-based phosphate binders further increase risk of vascular calcification progression. In both bone and vascular tissue, vitamin K-dependent processes play an important role in calcium homeostasis and it is tempting to speculate that vitamin K supplementation might protect from the potentially untoward effects of calcium supplementation. This review provides an update on current literature on calcium supplementation among post-menopausal women and CKD patients and discusses underlying molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification. We propose therapeutic strategies with vitamin K2 treatment to prevent or hold progression of vascular calcification as a consequence of excessive calcium intake.</snippet>

A literature search was performed to create dietetic practice for these patients based on the most recent evidence. For the purposes of nutritional recommendations, we divided the patients into 2 subgroups: 1) patients with CKD and dialysis, and 2) patients after kidney transplantation. Before surgery, nutritional care includes nutritional status evaluation and adjusting doses of supplements to treat deficiencies and daily nutrient intake according to the dietary restrictions derived from kidney disease, including quantities of fluids, protein, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins. After BS, these patients are at major risk for lean body mass loss, malnutrition and dehydration because of fluid restriction and diuretics. Postoperative nutritional recommendations should be carefully tailored according to CKD nutritional limitations and include specific considerations regarding protein, fluids, and supplementation, in particular calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D. Nutritional management of CKD and kidney transplant patients undergoing BS is challenging and future studies are required to establish uniform high-level evidence-based guidelines.</snippet>

A potent and effective inhibitor of ectopic calcification is eagerly expected. In the current study, the effects of FYB-931, a novel bisphosphonate compound synthesized for the prevention of ectopic calcification, were compared with those of etidronate using both in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, FYB-931 inhibited calcification of human aortic smooth muscle cells induced by high phosphate medium in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effect was slightly more potent than that of etidronate. In vivo, rats were administered with three subcutaneous injections of vitamin D3 to induce vascular calcification, and were given FYB-931 (1.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg) or etidronate (9, 30, or 60 mg/kg) orally once daily for 14 days. The increased aortic phosphorus content as an index of vascular calcification was inhibited by both FYB-931 and etidronate in a dose-dependent manner; however, FYB-931 was 10 times more potent than etidronate. FYB-931 inhibited serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) activity as a bone resorption marker 5.2 times more potently than etidronate.

The HRs of each 1 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D for albuminuria and impaired eGFR were 0.952(95%CI: 0.941-0.963) and 0.975(95%CI: 0.966-0.983) respectively. When use the classifications (sufficiency, insufficiency, deficiency) or quintiles of baseline 25(OH)D levels in the Cox model, the corresponding HRs showed an increasing trend along with the decrease of baseline 25(OH)D levels (p for trend &lt; 0.001). ... Higher 25(OH)D levels were inversely and independently associated with CKD incidence among Chinese elderly.

      <snippet>Calcific uremic arteriopathy (CUA), termed calciphylaxis, is a rare but highly fatal clinical syndrome. There is no clearly laboratory diagnostic criteria for CUA. The medium and small arterial calcification and microthrombosis discovered by skin biopsy, radiologic imaging，bone scan and the evidence of activation of the bone morphogenetic protein signal (BMPs) transduction pathway are useful for early diagnosis of this disease. The common therapies (including intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) and bisphosphonates, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and other symptomatic supports) are used for the management of wounds, pain, nutrition, dialysis and so on. Controlling the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and some complications of dialysis and drugs (such as warfarin, active vitamin D) can prevent CUA. However, CUA patients still have poor prognosis and high mortality. Since some patients progress rapidly, it is of great importance to make early diagnosis and provide effective treatments with multidisciplinary management.</snippet>

      <snippet>Vascular calcification is a critical complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) because it is predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality. In addition to the traditional mechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction and the osteoblastic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the regulation of calcification inhibitors, such as calciprotein particles (CPPs) and matrix vesicles plays a vital role in uremic vascular calcification in CKD patients because of the high prevalence of vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K governs the gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein (MGP) for inhibiting vascular calcification, and the vitamin D binding protein receptor is related to vitamin K gene expression. For patients with chronic kidney disease, adequate use of vitamin D supplements may play a role in vascular calcification through modulation of the calciprotein particles and matrix vesicles (MVs).</snippet>

      <snippet>As a common disorder, chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a great threat to human health. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complication of CKD characterized by disturbances in the levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D; abnormal bone formation affecting the mineralization and linear growth of bone; and vascular and soft tissue calcification. PTH reflects the function of the parathyroid gland and also takes part in the metabolism of minerals. The accurate measurement of PTH plays a vital role in the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Previous studies have shown that there are different fragments of PTH in the body&apos;s circulation, causing antagonistic effects on bone and the kidney. Here we review the metabolism of PTH fragments; the progress being made in PTH measurement assays; the effects of PTH fragments on bone, kidney, and the cardiovascular system in CKD; and the predictive value of PTH measurement in assessing the effectiveness of parathyroidectomy (PTX). We hope that this review will help to clarify the value of accurate PTH measurements in CKD-MBD and promote the further development of multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem with an estimated prevalence of 8.2%. This study reports glutathione deficiency, excess oxidative stress, and altered vitamin D metabolism in the kidney of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The levels of GCLC and GCLM gene expression were significantly downregulated and the protein carbonylation level, a hallmark of oxidative damage, was significantly increased in the kidney of HFD-fed mice. While the levels of VD-regulatory genes 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), VDR, and RXRα were significantly downregulated in the kidney of mice fed a HFD, those of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) were significantly elevated. In vitro, GSH deficiency per se causes excess oxidative damage (protein carbonylation), and significantly decreases the levels of VD-regulatory genes (CYP27B1, VDR, and RXRα), but increases levels of CYP24A1 in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC), similar to findings in the kidney of HFD-fed diabetic mice. L-cysteine supplementation restores GSH and prevents oxidative damage in RPTEC. These studies suggest a potential role of GSH precursor in reducing excess oxidative stress and renal injury that commonly accompanies obesity/diabetes.</snippet>

      <snippet>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often instructed to adhere to a renal-specific diet depending on the severity and stage of their kidney disease. The prescribed diet may limit certain nutrients, such as phosphorus and potassium, or encourage the consumption of others, such as high biological value (HBV) proteins. Eggs are an inexpensive, easily available and high-quality source of protein, as well as a rich source of leucine, an essential amino acid that plays a role in muscle protein synthesis. However, egg yolk is a concentrated source of both phosphorus and the trimethylamine N-oxide precursor, choline, both of which may have potentially harmful effects in CKD. The yolk is also an abundant source of cholesterol which has been extensively studied for its effects on lipoprotein cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Efforts to reduce dietary cholesterol to manage dyslipidemia in dialysis patients (already following a renal diet) have not been shown to offer additional benefit. There is a paucity of data regarding the impact of egg consumption on lipid profiles of CKD patients. Additionally, egg consumption has not been associated with the risk of developing CKD based on epidemiological studies. The egg yolk also contains bioactive compounds, including lutein, zeaxanthin, and vitamin D, which may confer health benefits in CKD patients. Here we review research on egg intake and CKD, discuss both potential contraindications and favorable effects of egg consumption, and describe the need for further research examining egg intake and outcomes in the CKD and end-stage renal disease population.</snippet>

We evaluated the associations among 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels, PTH levels, and mortality, and whether these associations varied by renal function. We used data from the Dong-gu Study, a population-based cohort in Korean adults. We analyzed the associations among intact PTH, 25OHD levels and mortality in 8580 participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression after adjusting for age, sex, month of sampling, lifestyle, and comorbidities. We also evaluated the effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A total of 860 deaths occurred during the follow-up period of 7.6 years. Compared to the first 25OHD quartile, the HRs of the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.16], 0.84 (95% CI 0.68-1.02), and 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.89), respectively. The association between intact PTH levels and mortality varied by renal function, and was both nonlinear and significant only in subjects with CKD. Compared to the second intact PTH quartile in such subjects, the HRs for the first, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.61 (95% CI 0.92-2.81), 1.97 (95% CI 1.17-3.31), and 2.19 (95% CI 1.33-3.59), respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrated that low serum levels of 25OHD are associated with an increased risk of mortality. Serum levels of intact PTH are nonlinearly associated with mortality only in subjects with CKD, with the lowest risk for mortality being evident in the second quartile.</snippet>

      <snippet>In chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperphosphatemia induces fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) expression that disturbs renal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25D) synthesis; thereby increasing parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. FGF-23 acts on the parathyroid gland (PTG) to increase 1α-hydroxylase activity and results in increase intra-gland 1,25D production that attenuates PTH secretion efficiently if sufficient 25D are available. Interesting, calcimimetics can further increase PTG 1α-hydroxylase activity that emphasizes the demand for nutritional vitamin D (NVD) under high PTH status. In addition, the changes in hydroxylase enzyme activity highlight the greater parathyroid 25-hydroxyvitmain D (25D) requirement in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT); the higher proportion of oxyphil cells as hyperplastic parathyroid progression; lower cytosolic vitamin D binding protein (DBP) content in the oxyphil cell; and calcitriol promote vitamin D degradation are all possible reasons supports nutritional vitamin D (NVD; e.g., Cholecalciferol) supplement is crucial in SHPT. Clinically, NVD can effectively restore serum 25D concentration and prevent the further increase in PTH level.

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major non-communicable disease associated with high rates of premature morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (deficiency of 25(OH)D or 25D) is greater in racial/ethnic minorities and in patients with CKD than the general population. Low 25D is associated with bone and mineral disorders as well as immune, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Thus, it has been suggested that low 25D contributes to the poor outcomes in patients with CKD. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D rises progressively with advancing severity of kidney disease with over 30% of patients with CKD stage 3 and 70% patients with CKD stage 5 estimated to have low levels of 25D.

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen even in the early stages of CKD. Several studies have shown a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with CKD. Low vitamin D levels upregulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), cause endothelial dysfunction, and increase inflammation. Epidemiological studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but a causal relationship has not been established. The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with CKD in adults requires therapies to decrease this elevated risk. However, results from several meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials in adults have not shown convincing evidence for the use of vitamin D therapy in improving cardiovascular outcomes. Lack of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials in children regarding the effectiveness and long-term safety of vitamin D treatment precludes any recommendations on its use to mitigate the cardiovascular burden of CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Background Dysfunctional endothelium may contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications in chronic kidney disease ( CKD ). Supplementation with active vitamin D has been proposed to have vasoprotective potential in CKD , not only by direct effects on the endothelium but also by an increment of α-Klotho. Here, we explored the capacity of the active vitamin D analogue paricalcitol to protect against uremia-induced endothelial damage and the extent to which this was dependent on increased α-Klotho concentrations. Methods and Results In a combined rat model of CKD with vitamin D deficiency, renal failure induced vascular permeability and endothelial-gap formation in thoracic aorta irrespective of baseline vitamin D, and this was attenuated by paricalcitol. Downregulation of renal and serum α-Klotho was found in the CKD model, which was not restored by paricalcitol. By measuring the real-time changes of the human endothelial barrier function, we found that paricalcitol effectively improved the recovery of endothelial integrity following the addition of the pro-permeability factor thrombin and the induction of a wound. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed that paricalcitol promoted vascular endothelial-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions and diminished F-actin stress fiber organization, preventing the formation of endothelial intracellular gaps. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that paricalcitol attenuates the CKD -induced endothelial damage in the thoracic aorta and directly mediates endothelial stability in vitro by enforcing cell-cell interactions.</snippet>

      <snippet>The pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) involves a very complex interaction between hemodynamic and inflammatory processes, leading to glomerular/vascular sclerosis, and fibrosis formation with subsequent evolution to end-stage of renal disease. Despite efforts to minimize the progression of CKD, its incidence and prevalence continue to increase. Besides cardiovascular diseases and infections, several studies demonstrate that vitamin D status could be considered as a non-traditional risk factor for the progression of CKD. Therefore, we investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in the course of moderate CKD in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (Nx). Adult male Wistar rats underwent Sham surgery or Nx and were subdivided into the following four groups: Sham, receiving standard diet (Sham); Sham VDD, receiving vitamin D-free diet (VDD); Nx, receiving standard diet (Nx); and VDD+Nx, receiving vitamin D-free diet (VDD+Nx). Sham or Nx surgeries were performed 30 days after standard or vitamin D-free diets administration. After validation of vitamin D depletion, we considered only Nx and VDD+Nx groups for the following studies. Sixty days after surgeries, VDD+Nx rats exhibited hypertension, a greater decline in renal function and plasma FGF-23 levels, renal hypertrophy, as well as higher plasma levels of PTH and aldosterone. In addition, those animals presented more significant chronic tubulointerstitial changes (cortical interstitial expansion/inflammation/fibrosis), higher expression of collagen IV, fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin, and lower expressions of JG12 and M2 macrophages. Also, VDD+Nx rats had greater infiltration of inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages and T-cells). Such changes were accompanied by higher expression of TGF-β1 and angiotensinogen and decreased expression of VDR and Klotho protein. Our observations indicate that vitamin D deficiency impairs the renal function and worsens the renovascular and morphological changes, aggravating the features of moderate CKD in 5/6 nephrectomized rats.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a systemic disorder that leads to vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis. Uric acid has been shown to associate with vascular calcification and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to suppress the 1 α-hydroxylase enzyme leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and higher intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid would reduce CIMT, calcification propensity, and circulating markers of CKD-MBD in CKD. ... This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind study of 80 patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia who received allopurinol or placebo for 12 weeks. CIMT and T50 were measured as markers of vascular disease and serum calcification propensity, respectively.

      <snippet>Vitamin D, apart from being an important part of the &quot;calcium-vitamin D-parathyroid hormone&quot; endocrine axis, has diverse range of &quot;non-calcemic&quot; biological actions. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been observed in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) worldwide. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in Nepalese RTRs and interrelations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] and other biochemical parameters. ... A total of 80 adult RTRs visiting a university hospital were enrolled in this cross sectional study. Serum 25(OH) D and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were measured using Enhanced Chemiluminiscent Immunoassay. The RTR population was categorized into recent transplant recipients (≤1 year) and long term recipients (&gt; 1 year). The vitamin D status was defined as per NKF/KDOQI guidelines. SPSS version 20.0 was used to analyze the data. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to compare variables between groups and establish correlation. P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ... The mean age of the recipients was 38.11 ± 11.47 years (68 males, 85.0%). Chronic glomerulonephritis was the leading cause of CKD. The two RTR groups (recent and long term) didn&apos;t differ in demographic and biochemical characteristics. 83.75% of the recipients had PTH levels above the upper limit of the recommended range for their stage of CKD. 57.5% had hypocalcemia and none of the recipients had hypercalcemia. The median serum 25(OH) D was 24.15 ng/ml (8.00-51.50 ng/ml). Only 27.5% had sufficient vitamin D status whereas 53.8% were vitamin D insufficient and 18.8% were vitamin D deficient, the distribution almost comparable in the 2 transplant group. The serum 25(OH) D was not significantly affected by the time post-transplant, gender and sunlight avoidance. There was a significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH) D and iPTH (Pearson&apos;s r = - 0.35, P = 0.001), but not so with the graft function. ... There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in RTRs. The deficiency status is not corrected despite of nutritional improvement and normalization of GFR post-transplantation and likely exacerbates secondary hyperparathyroidism.

      <snippet>As the GFR loss aggravates, the disturbed mineral metabolism worsens the bone microstructure and remodelling - scenario, which is known as CKD-mineral bone disease (MBD). CKD-MBD is characterized by : (i) abnormal metabolism of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or vitamin D; (ii) abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth or strength; (iii) soft-tissue calcifications, either vascular or extra-osseous. Uremic vascular calcification and osteoporosis are the most common complications related to CKD-MBD. Disregulated bone turnover by uremic toxin or secondary hyperparathyroidism disturbed bone mineralization and makes it difficult for calcium and inorganic phosphate to enter into bone, resulting in increased serum calcium and inorganic phosphate. Vascular calcification worsens by hyperphosphatemia and systemic inflammation. Since vitamin D deficiency plays an important role in renal osteodystrophy, supplement of nutritional vitamin D is important in treating uremic osteoporosis and vascular calcification at the same time. Its pleotropic effect improves the bone remodeling initiated by osteoblast and alleviates the risk factors for vascular calcification with less hypercalcemia than vitamin D receptor analogs. Therefore, nutritional vitamin D should be considered in managing CKDMBD.</snippet>

      <snippet>Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4 and is associated with poor outcomes. However, the evaluation and management of vitamin D deficiency in nephrology remains controversial. This article reports on the proceedings from a &quot;controversies conference&quot; on vitamin D in chronic kidney disease that was sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation. The report outlines the deliberations of the 3 work groups that participated in the conference. Until newer measurement methods are widely used, the panel agreed that clinicians should classify 25(OH)D &quot;adequacy&quot; as concentrations &gt; 20ng/mL without evidence of counter-regulatory hormone activity (ie, elevated parathyroid hormone). The panel also agreed that 25(OH)D concentrations &lt; 15ng/mL should be treated irrespective of parathyroid hormone level. Patients with 25(OH)D concentrations between 15 and 20ng/mL may not require treatment if there is no evidence of counter-regulatory hormone activity. The panel agreed that nutritional vitamin D (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, or calcifediol) should be supplemented before giving activated vitamin D compounds. The compounds need further study evaluating important outcomes that observational studies have linked to low 25(OH)D levels, such as progression to end-stage kidney disease, infections, fracture rates, hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. We urge further research funding in this field.</snippet>

      <snippet>The level of the vitamin D in the bloodstream is regulated by cytochrome P450 enzyme 24-hydroxylase A1 (CYP24A1). Over expression of CYP24A1 enzyme is correlated with vitamin D deficiency and resistance to vitamin D therapy. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly reported with the above said expression variations. This deregulation could be solved by ligands that act as a vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists and CYP24A1 antagonists. Posner et al., (2010) first time reported two new vitamin D analogues namely CTA-091 and CTA-018 to inhibit CYP24A1. The CTA-018 inhibited CYP24A1 with an IC50 27 ± 6 nM (10 times more potent than the ketoconazole (253 ± 20 nM)). CTA-018 induced VDR expression (15-fold lower than 1α,25(OH)2D3) and is under phase II clinical trial, whereas CTA-091 was not able to efficiently induce the VDR expression (&gt;2000 nM). To explore the molecular mechanism, binding specificity of these two vitamin D analogues along with native ligand was extensively studied through in silico approaches. Through molecular dynamics simulations studies, we shown that the sulfonic group (O = S = O) in the side chain of CTA-018 plays an important role in the regulation of VDR agonistic activity. The electron lone pairs of the sulfonic group that interacted with His393 lead to be a factor for agonistic mechanism of VDR activity. Compared to azol-based compounds, CTA-018 binds the different sites in the CYP24A1 binding cavity and thus it could be a potent antagonistic for CYP24A1enzyme.</snippet>

      <snippet>Mineral bone disease (MBD) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by disruption of normal mineral homeostasis within the body. One or more of the following may occur: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), decreased vitamin D and vascular calcification (VC). The greater the decrease in renal function, the worse the progression of CKD-MBD. These abnormalities may lead to bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures. CKD-MBD is a major contributor to the high morbidity and mortality among patients with CKD. Another well-known complication of CKD is cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by increased atherosclerosis and VC. CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. VC is linked to reduced arterial compliance that may lead to widened pulse pressure and impaired cardiovascular function. VC is a strong predicator of cardiovascular mortality among patients with CKD. Elevated phosphorus levels and increased calcium-phosphorus product promote VC. Controlling mineral disturbances such as hyperphosphatemia and SHPT is still considered among the current strategies for treatment of VC in CKD through restriction of calcium based phosphate binders in hyperphosphatemic patients across all severities of CKD along with dietary phosphate restriction and use of calciminetics. Additionally, Vitamin D insufficiency is common in CKD and dialysis patients. The causes are multifactorial and a serious consequence is SHPT. Vitamin D compounds remain the first-line therapy for prevention and treatment of SHPT in CKD. Vitamin D may also have atheroprotective effects on the arterial wall, but clinical studies do not show clear evidence of reduced cardiovascular mortality with vitamin D administration.

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of adults worldwide. Dysregulation of phosphorus homeostasis which occurs in CKD leads to development of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. Phosphorus is regulated by multiple hormones (parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihyxdroxyvitamin D (1,25D), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)) and tissues (kidney, intestine, parathyroid glands, and bone) to maintain homeostasis. In health, the kidneys are the major site of regulation for phosphorus homeostasis. However, as kidney function declines, the ability of the kidneys to adequately excrete phosphorus is reduced. The hormonal changes that occur with CKD would suggest that the intestine should compensate for impaired renal phosphorus excretion by reducing fractional intestinal phosphorus absorption. However, limited studies in CKD animal models and patients with CKD suggest that there may be a break in this homeostatic response where the intestine fails to compensate. As many existing therapies for phosphate management in CKD are aimed at reducing absolute intestinal phosphorus absorption, better understanding of the factors that influence fractional and absolute absorption, the mechanism by which intestinal phosphate absorption occurs, and how CKD modifies these is a much-needed area of study.</snippet>

In uraemic rats fed a HP diet, parathyroidectomy with serum PTH 1-34 supplementation resulted in (i) reduced aortic calcium (80%) by attenuating osteogenic differentiation (higher α-actin; reduced Runx2 and BMP2) and increasing the Wnt inhibitor Sclerostin, despite a similar degree of hyperphosphataemia, renal damage and serum Klotho; (ii) prevention of bone loss mostly by attenuating bone resorption and increases in Wnt inhibitors; and (iii) a 70% decrease in serum calcitriol levels despite significantly reduced serum Fgf23, calcium and renal 24-hydroxylase, which questions that Fgf23 is the main regulator of renal calcitriol production. Significantly, when vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed exclusively to high phosphate and calcium, high PTH enhanced while low PTH attenuated calcium deposition through parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) signalling. ...

      <snippet>Vitamin D (VD) is a pro-hormone essential for life in higher animals. It is present in few types of foods and is produced endogenously in the skin by a photochemical reaction. The final step of VD activation occurs in the kidneys involving a second hydroxylation reaction to generate the biologically active metabolite 1,25(OH)₂-VD. Extrarenal 1α-hydroxylation has also been described to have an important role in autocrine and paracrine signaling. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been in the spotlight as a major public healthcare issue with an estimated prevalence of more than a billion people worldwide. Among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), VDD prevalence has been reported to be as high as 80%. Classically, VD plays a pivotal role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of VD in many vital non-skeletal biological processes such as endothelial function, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation, redox balance and innate and adaptive immunity. In individuals with CKD, VDD has been associated with albuminuria, faster progression of kidney disease and increased all-cause mortality. Recent guidelines support VD supplementation in CKD based on extrapolation from cohorts conducted in the general population. In this review, we discuss new insights on the multifactorial pathophysiology of VDD in CKD as well as how it may negatively modulate different organs and systems. We also critically review the latest evidence and controversies of VD monitoring and supplementation in CKD patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is common in end-stage renal disease and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mainstays of treatment include decreasing serum phosphorus level toward the normal range with dietary interventions and phosphate binders and treating increased parathyroid hormone levels with activated vitamin D and/or calcimimetics. There is significant variation in serum levels of mineral metabolism markers, intestinal absorption of phosphorus, and therapeutic response among individual patients and subgroups of patients with end-stage renal disease. This variation may be partly explained by polymorphisms in genes associated with calcium and phosphorus homeostasis such as the calcium-sensing receptor gene, the vitamin D-binding receptor gene, and genes associated with vascular calcification. In this review, we discuss how personalized medicine may be used for the management of CKD-MBD and how it ultimately may lead to improved clinical outcomes. Although genetic variants may seem attractive targets to tailor CKD-MBD therapy, complete understanding of how these polymorphisms function and their clinical utility and applicability to personalized medicine need to be determined.</snippet>

Capillary rarefaction in the kidneys is thought to promote hypoxia, impair hemodynamic responses and predispose to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and hypertension development. Various mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the development of capillary rarefaction, including inflammation, an altered endothelial-tubular epithelial cell crosstalk, a relative deficiency in angiogenic growth factors, loss of pericytes, increased activity of Transforming growth factor -β1 and thrombospondin-1, vitamin D deficiency, a link to lymphatic neoangiogenesis and INK4a/ARF (Cylin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a; CDKN2A). In this review, we summarize the tools available to monitor capillary rarefaction noninvasively in the clinic, the contribution of capillary rarefaction to CKD and hypertension, the known mechanisms of capillary rarefaction, and potential future strategies to attenuate capillary rarefaction and reduce its negative impact.

Patients present in the first year of life with renal Fanconi syndrome that evolves to progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite the multiple risk factors for bone disease, the frequency and severity of skeletal disorders in nephropathic cystinosis have not been described. We performed systematic bone and mineral evaluations of subjects with cystinosis seen at the NIH (n = 30), including history and physical examination, serum and urine biochemistries, DXA, vertebral fracture assessment, skeletal radiographs, and renal ultrasound. Additionally, histomorphometric analyses are reported on six subjects seen at the UCLA Bone and Mineral Metabolism Clinic. In NIH subjects, mean age was 20 years (range, 5 to 44 years), 60% were CKD stages G1 to G4, and 40% had a renal transplant. Mean bone mineral density (BMD) Z-scores were decreased in the femoral neck, total hip, and 1/3 radius (p &lt; 0.05). Low bone mass at one or more sites was present in 46% of subjects. Twenty-seven percent of subjects reported one or more long bone fractures. Thirty-two percent of subjects had incidental vertebral fractures, which were unrelated to transplant status. Long-bone deformity/bowing was present in 64%; 50% had scoliosis. Diffuse osteosclerosis was present in 21% of evaluated subjects. Risk factors included CKD, phosphate wasting, hypercalciuria, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, male hypogonadism, metabolic acidosis, and glucocorticoid/immunosuppressive therapy. Sixty-one percent of the non-transplanted subjects had ultrasonographic evidence of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Histomorphometric analyses showed impaired mineralization in four of six studied subjects. We conclude that skeletal deformities, decreased bone mass, and vertebral fractures are common and relevant complications of nephropathic cystinosis, even before renal transplantation. Efforts to minimize risk factors for skeletal disease include optimizing mineral metabolism and hormonal status, combined with monitoring for nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis. © 2018 This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.</snippet>

      <snippet>In patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD), the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is much more common than in the general population. The role of vitamin D deficiency had been underestimated until a significant association was found between vitamin D therapy and survival benefit in haemodialysis patients. Vitamin D deficiency is present even in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The results of experimental studies have revealed the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and impairment of cardiac contractile function, higher cardiac mass and increased myocardial collagen content. Experimental models propose that intermediate end points for the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and higher risk of cardiovascular disease comprise diminished left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), enhanced left ventricular diastolic function, and decreased frequency of heart failure. Multiple observational studies have demonstrated an association between the use of active vitamin D therapy in patients on dialysis and with CKD and improved survival. However, there are also many studies indicating important adverse effects of such treatment. Therefore, large randomized trials are required to analyze whether supplementation of vitamin D may affect outcomes and whether it is safe to be used in CKD patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD) exhibit abnormalities in the circulating mineral levels, vitamin D metabolism, and parathyroid function that contribute to the formation of a bone lesion. The uremic toxin, indoxyl sulfate (IS), accumulates in the blood in cases of renal failure and leads to bone loss. The bone and renal responses to the action of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) are progressively decreased in CKD in spite of increasing PTH levels, a condition commonly called PTH resistance. There is a high prevalence of low bone turnover or adynamic bone disease in the early stages of CKD. This could be due to the inhibition of bone turnover, such as in PTH resistance, reduced active vitamin D levels, diabetes, aluminum, and, increased IS. With an increase in IS, there is a decrease in the osteoblast Wnt/b-catenin signaling and increase in the expression of Wnt signaling inhibitors, such as sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). Thus, a majority of early CKD patients exhibit deterioration of bone quality owing to the action of IS, this scenario could be termed uremic osteoporosis. However, this mechanism is complicated and not fully understood. With progressive deterioration in the renal function, IS accumulates along with persistent PTH secretion, potentially leading to high-turnover bone disease because high serum PTH levels have the ability of overriding peripheral PTH resistance and other inhibitory factors of bone formation. Finally, it leads to deterioration in bone quantity with prominent bone resorption in end stage renal disease. Uremic toxins adsorbents may decelerate oxidative stress and improve bone health in CKD patients. This review article focuses on IS and bone loss in CKD patients.</snippet>

Although no study has ever demonstrated conclusively that CKD-MBD control is associated with improved survival, an expanding therapeutic armamentarium is available to correct bone mineral abnormalities. In this position paper of Lombardy Nephrologists, a summary of the state of art of CKD-MBD as well as a summary of the unmet clinical needs will be provided. Furthermore, this position paper will focus on the potential and drawbacks of a new injectable calcimimetic, etelcalcetide, a drug available in Italy since few months ago.</snippet>

      <snippet>Guidelines for the assessment, diagnosis and therapy of the alterations that characterize the CKD-MBD are an important support in the clinical practice of the nephrologist. Compared to the KDIGO guidelines published in 2009, the 2017 update made changes on some topics on which there was previously no strong evidence both in terms of diagnosis and therapy. The recommendations include the diagnosis of bone anomalies in CKD-MBD and the treatment of mineral metabolism abnormalities with particular regard to hyperphosphataemia, calcium levels, secondary hyperparathyroidism and anti-resorptive therapies. The Italian Study Group on Mineral Metabolism, in reviewing the 2017 recommendations, aimed to assess the weight of the evidence that led to this update. In fact, on some topics there has not been a substantial difference on the degree of evidence compared to the previous guidelines. The Italian Study Group emphasizes the points that may still reserve critical issues, including interpretation, and invites an evaluation that is articulated and personalized for each patient.</snippet>

      <snippet>Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are various causes of renal anemia such as decreased production of erythropoietin, resistance to erythropoietin, shortened survival of red blood cells, and bone marrow fibrosis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a less recognized, but potentially significant cause of renal anemia in CKD patients. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been regarded as a uremic toxin that has multiple adverse effects, and its elevated levels have been associated with renal anemia in hemodialysis patients. Moreover, recent clinical studies have shown that the treatment of SHPT using either vitamin D receptor activators, calcimimetics, or parathyroidectomy leads to improvement of anemia, supporting the role of PTH in renal anemia. Emerging data have also indicated the involvement of bone-derived fibroblast growth factor 23 in renal anemia. This review summarizes recent insights into the role of PTH in renal anemia and discusses the importance of treating SHPT in improving the control of renal anemia in hemodialysis patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>Cardiovascular disease has earned its place as one of the leading noncommunicable diseases that has become a modern-day global epidemic. The increasing incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has added to this enormous burden, given that CKD is now recognized as an established risk factor for accelerated cardiovascular disease. In fact, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the CKD population, with significant prognostic implications. Alterations in vitamin D levels as renal function declines has been linked invariably to the development of cardiovascular disease beyond a mere epiphenomenon, and has become an important focus in recent years in our search for new therapies. Another compound, cinacalcet, which belongs to the calcimimetic class of agents, also has taken center stage over the past few years as a potential cardiovasculoprotective agent. However, given limited well-designed randomized trials to inform us, our clinical practice for the management of cardiovascular disease in CKD has not been adequately refined. This article considers the biological mechanisms, regulation, and current experimental, clinical, and trial data available to help guide the therapeutic use of vitamin D and calcimimetics in the setting of CKD and cardiovascular disease.</snippet>

      <snippet>Patients with CKD have accelerated vascular stiffening contributing significantly to excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Much of the arterial stiffening is thought to involve vascular calcification (VC), but the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is complex, resulting from a disruption of the balance between promoters and inhibitors of calcification in a uremic milieu, along with derangements in calcium and phosphate metabolic pathways. Management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors to reduce VC may be influential but has not been shown to significantly improve mortality. Control of mineral metabolism may potentially reduce the burden of VC, although using conventional approaches of restricting dietary phosphate, administering phosphate binders, and use of active vitamin D and calcimimetics, remains controversial because recommended biochemical targets are hard to achieve and clinical relevance hard to define. Increasing time on dialysis is perhaps another therapy with potential effectiveness in this area. Despite current treatments, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain high in this group. Novel therapies for addressing VC include magnesium and vitamin K supplementation, which are currently being investigated in large randomized control trials. Other therapeutic targets include crystallization inhibitors, ligand trap for activin receptors and BMP-7. This review summarizes current treatment strategies and therapeutic targets for the future management of VC in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <snippet>The manufacturer of the calcimimetic drug etelcalcetide was invited to make an evidence submission as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Single Technology Appraisal (STA) programme. Within this submission, they reported evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of etelcalcetide for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on haemodialysis. The Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC), part of the Wessex Institute at the University of Southampton, was the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) commissioned to appraise the company&apos;s submission. This article describes the ERG&apos;s review and critique of the company&apos;s submission and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee&apos;s subsequent guidance (issued in June 2017). The clinical-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company consisted of two double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing etelcalcetide with placebo, one RCT comparing etelcalcetide with cinacalcet, two single-arm extension studies of the above trials, and one single-arm study evaluating the effect of switching from cinacalcet to etelcalcetide. No study specifically examined the population specified in the NICE appraisal scope: patients refractory to standard therapy with phosphate binders and vitamin D (PBVD). None of these trials were designed to collect long-term efficacy data for outcomes such as mortality, bone fractures, cardiovascular events, or parathyroidectomies. Instead, biomarker data from the trials were mapped to long-term outcomes by an assumed linear relationship between the trial outcome, reduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by &gt; 30%, and the log-hazard ratios for the occurrence of clinical events derived from a large, long-term RCT of cinacalcet (the EVOLVE trial). After submission of a confidential Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount reducing etelcalcetide drug costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet was £14,778 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the company&apos;s base case. While this value is lower than the NICE threshold range of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained, it was the opinion of the ERG that the ICER was highly uncertain due to efficacy data limitations for etelcalcetide, inadequate synthesis of clinical-effectiveness evidence, and strong assumptions connecting short-term biomarker data with long-term clinical outcomes. The ERG produced an alternative base case for etelcalcetide versus cinacalcet, with an ICER of £22,400 per QALY gained, also subject to uncertainty. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended etelcalcetide as an option for the treatment of SHPT in adults with CKD only if treatment with a calcimimetic is indicated and cinacalcet is not suitable, subject to the company&apos;s provision of the agreed PAS discount.</snippet>

      <snippet>Thrombomodulin (TM) is a proteoglycan highly represented in the endothelial glycocalix that regulates the haemostasis and the endothelial response to inflammation. High soluble TM levels underlie a lower risk for coronary heart disease in population studies. Activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) upregulates TM, but the effect of this intervention on soluble TM has never been tested in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. ... We performed a post hoc analysis of a 12 weeks double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of VDR activation by paricalcitol (PCT) on endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) in the forearm (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01680198). Circulating TM was measured in the whole CKD population [88 patients: PCT n = 44; placebo n = 44] that took part into this trial. ... Soluble TM at baseline was inversely related to the glomerular filtration rate (r = -0.65, P &lt; 0.001) and to FMD (Spearman&apos;s ρ = -0.29, P = 0.01). Alongside the expected effects on bone mineral biomarkers, PCT produced a consistent rise (P = 0.005) in TM levels, from a median value of 8446.0 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR): 6227.8-10 910.8 pg/mL] to 9127.5 pg/mL (6393.0-11 287.3 pg/mL) while placebo had no effect (between-groups difference P = 0.008). TM levels re-approached baseline values 2 weeks after stopping PCT. TM changes across the trial paralleled simultaneous changes in FMD. ... VDR activation by PCT raises TM levels and FMD and such effects are rapidly reversible after stopping the treatment. The TM rise induced by PCT is a possible mechanism whereby improvement in endothelial function by VDR activation may favourably impact upon vascular health in CKD patients.</snippet>

      <snippet>Drug repurposing, is the re-tasking of known medications for new clinical indications. Advantages, compared to de novo drug development, include reduced cost and time to market plus the added benefit of a known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Suitable drug candidates are identified through serendipitous observations, data mining, or increased understanding of disease mechanisms. This review highlights drugs suited for repurposing in kidney disease. The main cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have included CV endpoints for the drugs. This review begins with candidates in acute kidney injury: vasodilators levosimendan and vitamin D, followed by candidates in CKD, with particular focus on diabetic kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Examples include glucose-lowering drugs (sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, and metformin), which have mechanistic potential for cardiac and/or renal protection beyond glucose lowering, with broader applicability to the nondiabetic population; xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat), selective endothelin receptor A antagonist (atrasentan), Janus kinase inhibitor (baricitinib), selective costimulation modulator (abatacept), pentoxyfylline, and the DNA demethylating agent/vasodilator (hydralazine).</snippet>

      <snippet>Insulin resistance (IR) is very common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism (MBD) seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is evolving as the most important link between MBD and many pathologic sequences of CKD. The aim was to evaluate IR in pre-dialysis CKD patients looking for a possible association to mineral metabolism among CKD patients. A total of 100 stage 3-5 CKD patients were selected beside 20 normal control subjects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess IR in selected cases. Both groups were compared for fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FBI), HOMA-IR, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH vit D), parathormone (PTH), and uric acid (UA). Correlation study between HOMA_IR and different studied parameters was performed. HOMA-IR is significantly higher in CKD (8.87 ± 3.48 vs. 3.97 ± 0.34 in CKD vs. control, respectively, p &lt; .001). In addition CKD patients have significantly higher FGF23 (235 ± 22.96 vs. 139 ± 12.3 pg/mL, p &lt; .001), PTH (76.9 ± 15.27 vs. 47.9 ± 2.52 pg/mL, p &lt; .001), P (4.3 ± 0.67 vs. 3.6 ± 0.23 mg/dL, p &lt; .001), and UA (5 ± 1.22 vs. 4.85 ± 0.48 mg/dL, p &lt; .001) and significantly lower Ca (8.2 ± 0.3 vs. 8.9 ± 0.33 mg/dL, p &lt; .001), and 25 (OH) vit D (17 ± 5.63 vs. 37 ± 3.43 ng/mL, p &lt; .001). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that BMI, GFR, Ca, P, and FGF23 were the only significant predictors of HOMA IR. Increased IR in CKD is a consequence of the uremic status and is intimately associated with disturbed phosphate metabolism and FGF23. Further studies are needed to look for an underlying mechanism.</snippet>

      <snippet>Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in in vitro liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</snippet>
